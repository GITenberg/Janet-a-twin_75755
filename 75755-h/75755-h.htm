JANET, A TWIN
<p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
A GLIMPSE OF JANET
</h3>

<p>
It was an every-day sort of a looking road,
broad and dusty and flat.  It ran straight
across the landscape and ended abruptly in a
merger of blue sky and sparkling sea.  On either
side of it sandy soil dotted with clusters of
dwarfed scrub oaks stretched out into limitless
space.  There was an uninteresting sameness
about its sunny dustiness that discouraged all
hope of adventure.
</p>

<p>
But on a late September afternoon it was the
setting of a little scene that marked the turning
place in the life of Janet Page.
</p>

<p>
The drowsy quiet was broken first by the short,
excited bark of a dog, a crackle of leaves and a
snapping of twigs in the scrub oak, and then
several things happened in quick succession.
</p>

<p>
A long snake scuttled into the road, a wiry little
Irish terrier bounded after it, followed by a whirling
fury of starched petticoats, long slender legs
and an immense red bow.
</p>

<p>
This was Janet.
</p>

<p>
A tiny cloud of dust curtained them all for a
minute; when it settled, it disclosed a rigid tableau.
Janet held the dog's collar in one strong little
brown hand, and with the other and the aid of
one foot she grasped the snake.
</p>

<p>
"Do something!" she demanded excitedly, as
she turned angry eyes toward a fat, roly-poly
figure that still remained partially hidden by the
scrub oak, watching the scene with an expression
of fear and distaste in his pale blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
This was Harry Waters.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to do?" he asked sulkily.
</p>

<p>
Janet was too much occupied to look at him,
but her voice expressed the contempt she felt.
</p>

<p>
"You might take Boru," she suggested.
</p>

<p>
Harry made a wide detour and, snatching the
dog, retreated hurriedly back to the side of the
road.
</p>

<p>
"You're not going to kill him," he said nervously,
and he pointed a trembling finger at the
wriggling snake.
</p>

<p>
For answer, Janet picked up a large stone.
Harry turned his face away.  He wanted to put
his fingers in his ears so that he would not hear
the soft thud that followed, but the frantic dog
made that impossible.
</p>

<p>
"Come on back," Janet said at last; "he's
quite dead, and I've thrown him into the bushes,
so you won't even have to look at him."  Her
voice sounded very grown up and patronizing, and
Harry justly resented it.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, Janet Page," he exploded;
"you needn't put on airs.  It's not such a big
thing to kill a snake anyway," he finished lamely.
"I could have done it only I didn't see any sense
in it; even if it had bitten Boru, it wouldn't have
hurt him any."  Harry was trying hard to justify
an act that he hardly understood himself.  He
was a nice boy, two years Janet's senior, and until
to-day he had never let her forget his advantage.
</p>

<p>
He tried to assert it now.
</p>

<p>
"You see, I'm older than you are and I've got
lots more sense.  I knew that a snake like that
couldn't really hurt a dog and so I just&mdash;"  He
paused, and under Janet's cool gaze he blushed
very slowly, right up to the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you tell the truth?" she asked
quietly.  "You know you are afraid of snakes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what if I am?"  Harry shifted his feet
uncomfortably.  "I can't help it, can I?
Anyway, your grandmother says&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what my grandmother says,"
Janet interrupted angrily.  "I know it all by
heart.  She says you are a very mannerly little
boy; that's because you never forget to take off
your hat when you go into her room.  And she
says you're respectful; that's because you always
say 'yes, ma'm; no ma'm; thank you, ma'm,' and
she says you always look tidy, and that's because
you never climb trees and always wear shoes and
stockings, no matter how hot it is, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can't help it if my mother makes me, can I?"
Harry blazed out.
</p>

<p>
Janet paused to consider.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't suppose you can," she said at last;
"only somehow I wish you were different."  Her
gaze traveled slowly from his round-toed boots to
his neatly brushed hair; a dreamy look came into
her eyes, and the little flecks of gold in the
soft-brown iris caught the sun's rays and glistened.
She sighed profoundly.
</p>

<p>
"But if you couldn't kill a snake," she said,
speaking more to herself than to him, "why, you
couldn't ever kill a dragon, you see; nor ride a
coal-black charger, nor fight for your lady's
favor&mdash;"  Her brow wrinkled in a puzzled frown,
but it cleared almost at once.  "I was forgetting,"
she laughed; "you wouldn't want to anyway,
so it doesn't matter; that is, not so very
much."
</p>

<p>
She looked around her for Boru; he was busily
investigating the remains of the snake in the
bushes, but at her whistle he trotted obediently to
her heel, and together they walked off down the
road.
</p>

<p>
Harry, after a miserable minute of indecision,
followed.
</p>

<p>
They walked in silence, Janet a little ahead,
until they reached the road that ran along the
waterfront and passed the white gate of the old
Page house.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going to go with me any more!"
Harry asked forlornly.
</p>

<p>
Janet stopped and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe."
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't care if you don't; you're just
a girl anyway."  Harry's lip trembled ever so
slightly and he turned on his heel and hurried
off, trying to hold his head high.
</p>

<p>
Janet swung on the gate for a few minutes and
watched him until a bend in the road hid him from
view, then she went up the long flight of stone
steps.
</p>

<p>
The Page house crowned the terrace above.  It
was big, somber and very old.  To Janet it seemed
to be very tired, too, as though it had waited and
watched a long time for the sea, whose waves beat
incessantly on the shore below, to yield some secret
now long forgotten by the living world.
</p>

<p>
Four stern columns guarded the square porch
and the old-fashioned, ivory-white door with its
leaded fan lights and heavy knocker.  Janet
slipped noiselessly into the wide hall that reflected
the glow of polished mahogany and soft afternoon
sunlight.  Just as she tiptoed across the thick rag
rugs and was half way up the stairs, the big
grandfather clock boomed three, and as if in echo
to it a voice, quavering but still clear and
penetrating, called:
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
Janet had a sudden and unheard of wish not to
answer, but she conquered it and replied at once:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandmother, it's me."  Before the
words had had time to float down the stairs she
was conscious of her mistake.  "Drat the
personal pronoun anyway," she said to herself; "now
I will catch it."
</p>

<p>
"Janet, I called you," the voice came again, and
Janet started guiltily.
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming, grandmother," she answered,
and walked primly back downstairs.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Page's room was on the first floor at the
back of the house away from the sea and overlooking
a trim little garden.  An old-fashioned
sleigh bed stood between the windows, and in the
very middle of it a little old lady, wearing an
immense cap, sat propped up against half a dozen
pillows.
</p>

<p>
This was Mrs. Page, Janet's grandmother.  She
was perhaps the most feared and certainly the
most respected woman in Old Chester, and
although she had been bedridden for as many years
as Janet could remember she took a lively interest
in the affairs of the community, and no important
step was ever taken until Cap'n Page's widow
was consulted.  Her advice had a way of sounding
very much like a command.
</p>

<p>
Janet knew the room by heart.  She could have
told the location of everything in it with her eyes
blindfolded, so she wasted no time in looking about
her but went straight up to the bed and sat down
on the low chair, where all Mrs. Page's callers
sat.  It was placed so that she could see them
without twisting her neck; a thing she particularly
disliked having to do.
</p>

<p>
"You called me, grandmother?"
</p>

<p>
Two steely blue eyes opened slowly, and seemed
to bore into the soft depth of Janet's brown ones.
</p>

<p>
"I did; there can be no doubt of that; nor, I
may add, of your reply."
</p>

<p>
For perhaps the first time in her life Janet
interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"I know I said me instead of I, but I was thinking
of something else and I forgot," she exclaimed
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"And may I ask what you were thinking of?"
Mrs. Page inquired in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Janet frowned and shook her head.  "It's not
the slightest use to, for you'd never, never
understand.  You see, it was something entirely
different from all this."  She looked around the
immaculate room and shook her head again, this
time in despair.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Page lifted herself on to one elbow and
looked at her grand-daughter carefully for a full
minute.
</p>

<p>
"Janet," she said severely, "what has come
over you?"
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, for Janet did not reply.
She was watching a butterfly out in the garden
and trying to decide what it was he was whispering
to that big floppy rose.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Page settled back into her pillows and
pulled the coverlet well up under her chin.
</p>

<p>
"You may go," she said, pointing a bony finger
toward the door.  "I am about to write to your
brother.  I regret that I will have to tell him that
you are not only careless but rude."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandmother."  Janet stood up, and
after she had carefully straightened the chair
upon which she had been sitting she walked quietly
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Once in the hall, with the door closed, a tiny
sigh escaped her.  She leaned up against the old
clock and stared at a patch of sunlight on the rug;
Two big round tears rolled down her cheeks
unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
Boru came over inquisitively from his place by
the stairs and licked her hand.  She dropped to
her knees beside him and hugged him impulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, old fellow," she whispered.
"Let's go up to the 'widow's walk' and think it
all out.  I guess grandmother is right; something
has come over me."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
ON THE WIDOWS' WALK
</h3>

<p>
"But just what is it?" she mused a few
minutes later, as she settled herself
comfortably and pulled Boru's shaggy head
down to her knee.
</p>

<p>
The "widows' walk" was Janet's favorite place
in which to think things out, for it was on the flat
roof of the house, away from any possible
interruptions.  Martha, the old servant, had long ago
given up attempting the rickety stairs that led
to it.  It was in itself a rather dangerous spot.
Many of the boards that went to make the platform
were broken or badly rotted from long
exposure to wind and rain.  The railing that ran
around it was in the last stage of decay.  But
there was something about it, perhaps the feeling
of being up among the tree tops, that made Janet
disregard its dangers.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, she was content to sit and gaze out
to sea and "pretend."  The name, "widows'
walk," opened up so many avenues of imaginings.
She often saw the ghosts of the poor distracted
women of long ago, pacing up and down, their
eyes always turned toward the sea, searching for
a familiar masthead.  Old Chester had once been
a famous fishing village, and the roof of every
house along the shore was topped by some sort
of observatory.  Sometimes it was a square glass
cupola, but more often it was a wooden walk,
such as crowned the Page house, and because in so
many, many cases the looked-for boats never did
return to harbor, these walks unhappily came to
be called "widows' walks."
</p>

<p>
To-day, however, Janet had no time for fancy.
Something inside her head and her heart was
demanding to be put into words.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what is the matter with me!" she
said again.  "I feel awfully different.  I suppose
I'm unhappy.  Am I, do you think!"
</p>

<p>
If any one had accused Janet of talking to herself
she would have resented it hotly, but it was
characteristic of her to pour out her troubles to
the ever-patient and understanding Boru.
</p>

<p>
"I'm lonely, for one thing," she confided as she
pulled one velvety soft ear.  "Of course any one
but you would say that was silly, for I have Harry
to play with, and then there are the Blake
children."  Two well-behaved, very clean and very
shiny girls filled her imagination for an
instant, but she dismissed them with a frown.
"They don't count, because they simply won't
play the way I want to.  Harry is a boy, and I
do&mdash;no, I did like him a little better, but you
know, old fellow, that after the way he acted
to-day about the snake, I just&mdash;well, he is a
scare-cat and that's all there is about it."
</p>

<p>
Boru's eyes, almost as brown as his mistress's,
looked up in solemn confirmation of her last remark.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts wandered for a minute and then
came back to the original idea.
</p>

<p>
"I guess lonely isn't just exactly the word,
but it's something a lot like it.  I want some one
to be with who is more like me&mdash;"  She broke
off suddenly, "I wish I had a sister," she
whispered softly.  Her arm tightened around Boru's
neck, and she buried her head in his shaggy coat.
Then quite suddenly she sat bolt upright, and her
eyes flashed.  "I'm mad, too; mad all the way
through at everything and everybody except
you,"&mdash;Boru acknowledged the exception with an
affectionate lick&mdash;"and I think the person I'm the
very maddest at is my big brother Thomas.  He's
not a bit the kind of a brother to have."  She
jumped up suddenly, and the breeze coming in
from the water took the skirt of her gingham dress
and flapped it as it would a sail.
</p>

<p>
"Boru, do you know what I am going to do!"
she demanded very seriously.
</p>

<p>
Boru was a little surprised and disturbed at
being so unceremoniously upset but he cocked one
ear expectantly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to write and tell him so," she
announced defiantly.
</p>

<p>
Her determination did not leave her even when
she was seated at her big desk, where everything
was arranged in perfect order for letter writing.
Janet had written her brother at stated intervals
during her thirteen years, but each and every
letter had always been carefully read and
corrected by her grandmother.  Stiff and formal
notes were the result.  As for answers, she had
never received any, as far back as she could
remember, but a brief typewritten note reached her
grandmother twice a year and stated, rather than
said, that Thomas was well and that the ranch
in far-away Arizona was as successful as could
be expected under the conditions of the present
year.  True, he never forgot to send his love to
Janet, but Janet, from early childhood, had had
a very decided idea about that sort of love.
To-day she meant to make that idea known.
</p>

<p>
With a great deal of care and precision she
selected an especially clean sheet of paper and a
square and very businesslike envelope, put a new
gold pen in her penholder and set to work.  The
first words she wrote were "Dear Thomas," then
she stopped.  There were so many things she
wanted to say.  She looked to Boru for inspiration
He was gazing thoughtfully at a fly that
was crawling along the floor; the instant it started
to fly he pounced on it.  Janet laughed.  "Thanks,
Boru; that is just what I'll do myself; I'll gobble
Thomas up all at once."  She turned back to her
desk and wrote under the "Dear Thomas:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I have been meaning to write to you for ever
so long and to say just what I wanted to, and so
I might as well tell you right away that grandmother
is not going to see this letter at all.  It's
just from me to you, and I'm not going to be
particular about grammar or blots.  The most
'special things I have to say are all questions, and
then some other things that are not very nice.
Perhaps I'd better start with those.  The first one
is that I think you would be a lot nicer if you
called yourself Tom or Tommy, instead of
Thomas.  Of course I don't know what you look
like, for the only picture we have of you is a baby
one that I know you would perfectly hate, but I
think you are short and frown a lot, and I hope
you haven't a beard but I'm afraid you have.  I
just told Boru, that's my dog, but you probably
wouldn't like him, that you were not a bit what a
big brother ought to be, and I really don't think
you are, and I might as well say that you would
have been much more of a comfort to me if you'd
been a sister.
</p>

<p>
"The questions I want to ask you are: What
do you do in Arizona, and are you ever coming
home, and do you ride horseback, and don't you
like to be with lots of people instead of just with
a few that some one else chooses for you, and
what would you think of a boy who was afraid of
snakes?  If you say that he's a sensible boy&mdash;that's
what grandmother would say&mdash;I'll never
like you, never.
</p>

<p>
"If I only knew you and you were nice like the
boys in the books I read, how many things we
could talk over!  I could ask you about all the
things that really matter&mdash;the things that
grandmother won't even let me mention.  Thomas, I'm
really not too young to be told things.  I'd grow
up all in a minute if I could be with girls my own
age.  But I don't expect you'll understand, so I
won't write any more.  I've said some of the
things I wanted to and that makes me feel a little
tit better."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She hesitated over the ending, and finally
decided just to sign her name.  Then without
reading over what she had written, lest her resolve
weaken, she folded up the paper and put it into
its envelope.
</p>

<p>
Boru's tail thumping on the floor made her
conscious of steps outside her door, and she hastily
finished writing the address and slipped the letter
into her pocket just as Martha opened her door.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Janet, not dressed for your tea,
and it almost six o'clock, and Mrs. Waters with
your grandmother and wanting to see you!  Tut,
tut!"  Martha shook her gray head in real
despair.  She was a kindly old woman, who had
served faithfully all her life, but because it was
so simple for her to do what was expected of her
always she had never understood how hard it was
sometimes for others; but she was never cross and
usually contented herself with saying, "Tut, tut!"
in her mild old voice at all Janet's failings.
</p>

<p>
"What does Mrs. Waters want me for?" Janet
asked.  A vision of Harry's mother retailing the
afternoon's adventure with the snake made her
heart sink.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't say, my dear," Martha replied
placidly.  "Your grandmother sent me to get you.
Here now, brush up your hair a bit.  Are your
hands clean?"
</p>

<p>
Janet submitted to being tidied up, and then
hurried downstairs to her grandmother's room.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Waters was seated in the visitor's chair,
her back to the door, but she turned around as
Janet entered and smiled a welcome.  Mrs. Page
spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Janet, what is all this I hear about your knowing
how to take care of sick dogs?" she inquired
crossly.
</p>

<p>
Janet hesitated.  She did know a good deal
about the care of all animals, but she was at a
loss as to how to explain her knowledge to her
grandmother.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you or don't you know anything about
them?" Mrs. Page insisted impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do know about them."  Janet's reply
came so quickly that it surprised herself.
</p>

<p>
Her grandmother looked at her for a long
minute and then nodded her head.  "Very well; go
with Mrs. Waters and do what you can for her
dog," she said sharply, and then to indicate that
the interview was at an end she turned her back
on her visitors.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Waters took Janet's arm and hurried out
of the room.  She was a timid little woman, very
easily silenced, and she still spoke in a half
whisper when they were out of the house.
</p>

<p>
"It's Roy, my dear, our English setter; he has
hurt his paw, and the veterinary is away," she
explained.
</p>

<p>
Janet gave a mighty sigh of relief.  Harry had
not told tales.  She smiled at his mother reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old fellow.  I hope I can do something
to help him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm sure you can.  Harry says you are
wonderful with animals," Mrs. Waters replied.
"Roy is such a valuable dog," she added.
</p>

<p>
They reached the Waters' cottage, just off the
main street of the little village, and Janet followed
Mrs. Waters around to the barn.  Before the door
was opened, she could hear the low moan of an
animal in pain.  Once inside, she knelt down
beside Roy and patted him.  He gave her the
affectionate welcome, always awarded a true dog
lover.
</p>

<p>
She examined his paw and found the trouble
to be a deeply embedded splinter.
</p>

<p>
"May I have a darning needle? she asked.
Mrs. Waters hurried to the house to get it.  Janet
busied herself filling a basin with clear spring
water, and she took the towel from its roller on
the kitchen porch.
</p>

<p>
"Here it is, my dear," Mrs. Waters said, "and
a bottle of peroxide.  You don't mind if I don't
stay, do you!  I'd be sure to faint."
</p>

<p>
Janet smiled.  "No indeed.  I can get along
quite well alone," she said, and knelt to her task.
</p>

<p>
For the next few minutes she was absorbed in
her work.  The splinter was in deep, and it was
hard to make Roy lie still.  She was about to
give up in despair when a voice, almost at her
elbow, said:
</p>

<p>
"Here, let me help."
</p>

<p>
She turned quickly, startled, and saw a boy
about fifteen, very shabbily dressed in old blue
overalls and a torn straw hat.  His hair, burnt by
the sun, was almost red, and his eyes were a clear
gray.  Janet was too astonished to speak, but
with a nod she accepted his offer to help, and they
worked in silence until the splinter was out and
the wound carefully bathed.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'll let him lick it," Janet said, putting
aside the bandage Mrs. Waters had given her.
The boy nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Best way," he said.  "Do you know horses
as well as dogs!" he inquired slowly.
</p>

<p>
"No, we haven't any, you see," Janet replied,
as she gathered up the things and started for the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Too bad."  The boy spoke with a drawl that
had nothing of laziness in it but a good deal of
dreamy calculation.  He leaned over and patted
Roy.  "Good night, old fellow," he said, and
without a word more to Janet he disappeared as
quietly as he had come.
</p>

<p>
Janet went on into the house, wondering who
he could be, but for some reason she did not ask
Mrs. Waters, perhaps because that good lady was
too busy thanking her.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are so clever, dearie," she said
warmly.  "I wonder where Harry can be.  It's
dark, and he ought to see you home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't bother Harry," Janet protested.
"I'll run all the way and I'll be there in no time.
I'll be down to see Roy to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
As soon as she was out of sight of the cottage
she did run.  It was quite chilly, and the salt
wind in her face made her blood tingle, and all
the worries of the day faded away with the last
glow of the sunset.  It was not until she was
undressing for bed, several hours later, that she
remembered her letter.  Her time had been taken
up thinking about the strange boy who had come
so quietly to her aid.  When she went to the
pocket of her dress to look for it, it was not there.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
MRS. TODD INTERVENES
</h3>

<p>
"What are you in such a hurry with
your breakfast for, child?"  Martha,
her hands on her big hips, stood
in the doorway between the dining-room and the
kitchen, and looked at Janet with mild curiosity.
</p>

<p>
It was a gray, misty morning, with a salty taste
and feel to everything.  Janet looked up from
her place where, with the assistance of Boru,
she was finishing the last strip of bacon on her
plate.
</p>

<p>
"I want to go over to the Waters' to see how
Roy is," she explained only half truthfully, for
her thoughts were almost entirely centered on the
hope of finding the letter she had lost the night
before.
</p>

<p>
"Well, dearie me, that's no reason for bolting
your food," Martha protested, but she let the
matter drop and went back into her kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting to stop at her grandmother's
room, Janet hurried out of the house and started
for the village.  She kept her eyes on the road,
but the Waters' cottage was reached without a
sign of the missing white envelope.
</p>

<p>
Harry was lurking in the doorway of the barn,
and Janet called a cheery greeting to him.  There
was no sign of the boy with the torn straw hat.
</p>

<p>
"How's my patient" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, he's all right."  Harry was still a little
resentful, for he was thinking of the snake.  Janet
had completely forgotten it.
</p>

<p>
Roy, at the first sound of her voice, got up from
his place in the hay and wagged his tail.  Janet
knelt and inspected the paw.
</p>

<p>
"It's a whole lot better, isn't it, old fellow?"
she asked as she patted him.  "Keep it clean and
don't walk on it," she advised seriously.
</p>

<p>
Harry, watching her, laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You'd think Roy was a human being to hear
you go on.  He doesn't know what you're talking
about," he said.
</p>

<p>
Janet did not reply, but she smiled into the
dog's eyes, and Harry had an uncomfortable
feeling that they were both laughing at him.
</p>

<p>
As she talked, Janet made a careful search for
the letter but it was nowhere to be seen, and with
a sinking feeling at her heart she realized that
some one must have found it.  But whom?  She
knelt on the floor beside Roy, and the thought
worried her brain.  If Mrs. Waters had it she
would, of course, take it to Mrs. Page and
then&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders.  It was foolish to
worry over it anyway, until something happened.
It would be a simple matter to write another, but
somehow the spirit that had prompted her to
revolt the day before was gone.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing anyway?"&mdash;Harry interrupted
her musings.  She gave a characteristic
little shrug and jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much," she replied, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Harry had been doing some thinking himself
for the last few minutes, and he had come to the
decision that it never paid to get mad at Janet,
for no matter how cross you acted she never even
bothered to notice you.  So it was with a very
different tone of voice that he asked as she started
for home:
</p>

<p>
"Do you care if I go along with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, come on if you want to," Janet replied,
and together they walked down the path.
</p>

<p>
"Let's stop at the post office," Janet suggested,
her thoughts, in spite of her determination to
forget it, still on the letter.
</p>

<p>
As they neared the little, low, red-brick building
almost covered by dark green ivy that served as
post office and general store for Old Chester, they
noticed a horse and cart with bright yellow wheels
drawn up at the curb.  The harness was new and
shining, and the horse, a beautiful sorrel with
slender legs, tossed his head impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Why, who does that belong to?" Janet exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno," Harry was not particularly interested.
"Guess it's Mrs. Todd's.  I heard mother
talking about her last night.  She is visiting at
the rectory, 'cause she's a cousin or something of
Mrs. Blake's."  The door of the post office opened
and he lowered his voice.  "Here she comes now."
</p>

<p>
Janet looked up and saw a tall, mannish-looking
woman, dressed in a rough serge suit and
heavy boots, coming toward them.  She had on a
soft gray felt hat without any trimming, and she
carried a market basket over her arm.  Her eyes
were small but they were so very blue and
penetrating that Janet felt they must be making holes
in the back of her head.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, whose children are you?" she demanded
rather than asked as she put her basket into the
cart She turned to Harry.  "You're Harry
Waters.  I know but you."  She scrutinized
Janet, and suddenly her face softened and she
put one big hand on her slender shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You're a Page," she said.  "The Pages all
have straight short noses.  Wait a minute and let
me think.  Haven't you a sister?"
</p>

<p>
Janet shook her head and smiled.  It was a
merry smile, for she suddenly realized that she
liked this queer, outspoken woman very much.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't a sister," she replied.  "I wish
I had.  I have a brother and a grandmother, and
I think that's all, except Boru."  She looked
down at the dog who was sniffing at the stranger's
skirts.  "Your horse is a beauty," she added
shyly.
</p>

<p>
"Like him?  So do I.  Suppose you drive me
home; that is, to the rectory.  I am staying there,
and my name is Ann Todd.  Here you are!
Jump in, Harry.  If you can wind up those fat
legs of yours you will just fit in the back."
</p>

<p>
Janet had hard work not to show her surprise,
for it was even greater than her delight.  She
had never, in all her short life, met any one who
out off their sentences as though they were
clipping threads and who made up their minds so
quickly.
</p>

<p>
They reached the rectory before she could think
of anything to say, and then all she could stammer
was, "Oh, thank you ever so much; it was simply
thrilling."
</p>

<p>
Alice and Mildred Blake were sitting in the
tiny little flower garden, both busy with yards of
green bunting which they were sewing together
in long strips.  They looked up in surprise as they
saw Janet and Harry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Janet, will your grandmother really let
you; isn't that wonderful!" they exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Janet was utterly bewildered.  "What are you
talking about!" she demanded.  "Will my
grandmother let me do what!"
</p>

<p>
Alice and Mildred looked at each other in
confusion, and then at Mrs. Todd.
</p>

<p>
"We thought&mdash;" Alice began.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin Ann and mother said&mdash;" finished Mildred.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd laughed heartily at their embarrassment
and put her arm around Janet.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I can explain," she said.  "The girls
are talking about the church fair.  Their mother
said something last night about your grandmother's
never letting you take any part in it,
and I said that I would undertake to see that you
came this year, and so I will."  Her jaw snapped
with such decision as she said these words that
Janet almost jumped.
</p>

<p>
"That's awfully nice of you," she replied
politely, "but grandmother's mind is rather hard
to change.  I never try."
</p>

<p>
"Why won't she let you?" Alice asked timidly.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly remember,"&mdash;Janet laughed.  "It's
so long since I ceased to come.  I was ten then
and I thought it would be such fun, but&mdash;well,
I didn't, and I've never asked since.  I think
being out late was one of the reasons."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" was all Mrs. Todd had to say, but
a few minutes later she offered to drive Janet
home.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll stop in and say 'how do you do,' too,
while I'm there," she decided.
</p>

<p>
On the way, as they bowled along the soft sandy
road, Janet worried a little.  It was luncheon
time, and her grandmother never saw visitors
until after three o'clock, but it would be quite
useless even to try to explain this to Mrs. Todd,
for in her own way she was just as positive and
determined as the eccentric Mrs. Page.
</p>

<p>
"Grim as ever,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd laughed as the
house came into view.  "It's twenty years since
I opened that front door but, bless my soul, I know
that everything is going to be just the same."
</p>

<p>
"Why, did you ever live here!" Janet looked
at her companion in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I did, and I was in this house almost as much
as I was in my own.  Your father and I were
the best of friends."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" was all Janet had time to say, before
Martha appeared at the door.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd nodded to her and tied the horse to
the garden gate and walked slowly up the narrow,
moss-grown walk, a whimsical smile on her thin
face.
</p>

<p>
Martha was speechless, and Janet had to laugh
as she watched her curl one end of her apron into
a hard little knot.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Martha,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd held out her hand&mdash;"don't
look as though you had seen a ghost."
</p>

<p>
Martha managed to say something, but she was
quite powerless to stop the visitor from striding
into the house and walking unannounced into
Mrs. Page's room.
</p>

<p>
Janet sat down on the stone seat in the garden
and waited.  Boru stretched out on the path at
her feet and panted after his run.  Not a sound
came from the house.
</p>

<p>
Janet did not try to imagine what was going
on in her grandmother's room.  She was
conscious that a big change had come into her life,
and she dimly realized that in the future she
would spend more time in thinking than she had
ever spent before.  It seemed as though she was
conscious of the world around her, and instead of
just accepting it she felt that she was a part of it.
</p>

<p>
"Janet Page," she said aloud, and stared hard
at the old sun-dial.  Suddenly Boru barked, and
she jumped as though she had been wakened from
a dream.  The dog rushed to the corner of the
garden, and Janet looked up just in time to see
the rim of a torn straw hat disappear over the wall.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
JANET'S KINGDOM
</h3>

<p>
Janet did not have time to investigate
further, for at that moment Martha beckoned
her mysteriously into the house.  It was
plain to be seen that the old servant was greatly
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter!" Janet inquired in a
whisper, for she caught some of the suspense.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Janet, whatever shall we do?" Martha
exclaimed.  "Mrs. Todd walked into your
grandmother's room, and they have been arguing
ever since.  Your grandmother will have a turn
I know, and yet I don't dare to interrupt them.
What shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
It was a proof of the Great Change to be consulted,
and Janet smiled with something like pride.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't do anything if I were you," she
replied quietly.  "Perhaps they are not arguing
any more.  They may just be talking; they're old
friends, you know."
</p>

<p>
Martha shot a quick glance toward the closed
door.  "Old friends," she said, and then, thinking
better of it, she did not finish the sentence, but said
instead, "Sit down to your luncheon, child, do; it's
getting cold and there's no reason to wait."
</p>

<p>
Janet nodded and went into the dining-room.
She took a long time over her chops and sweet
potatoes, but she finished without hearing the door
to her grandmother's room open.
</p>

<p>
Martha was almost in tears.  "Your grandmother
has had no luncheon," she protested.
"Dearie me, what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Take my advice and wait until she calls you,"
Janet advised.  "You know she doesn't like to be
disturbed.  I'm going out," she added.  "No,
Boru, you can't come to-day; stay home, like a
good dog."
</p>

<p>
Boru buried his head in his paws and with a
very mournful expression watched her leave.  He
knew that there was one mysterious place to
which he was never allowed to accompany his
mistress, and he resented it.  He was right in
guessing that she was going there to-day.
</p>

<p>
Janet left the house by the door that led to
the steps and down to the sea road.  The water
looked sparkling blue and inviting, and she
hurried along until she came to a small dock, very
much the worse for age.  She untied a row boat
and found two broken oars that were hidden in
the tall grass beside the road.  There was no one
in sight as she pushed off, and only a few sails
were visible flapping smartly out beyond the harbor.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks were flushed as she sent the old boat
skimming over the water, for she was on her way
to her secret kingdom.  Though she had sailed to
it many times there was always the chance of
discovery, and that added zest to the adventure.
</p>

<p>
The point of land toward which she was heading
was quite a distance off, and looked to be
rather a desolate island.  It was, in reality,
however, a part of the mainland, for the bay came in,
and the land around it was shaped like a big hook.
There were a few fishing huts along the shore, and
farther inland low farms nestled into the hills.
</p>

<p>
Janet chose a certain cove to land in and pulled
her boat safely up on shore, and then she started
off at a brisk walk.  At this particular point of
the beach the sand dunes were very high, and she
was screened from sight except from the water
front.  She walked for about a quarter of a mile
and then began to climb.  Up above her on a
rising knoll of ground a little way beyond the
sand dunes was an old gray house.  It was large
and very rambling, but it was tumbling down.
The roof sagged at one end, and the two big
chimneys were crumbling to ruin.  There was not
a sign of life anywhere about it or in the many
ramshackled farm buildings that evidently
belonged to it.  All the windows were boarded up
but one, a very small one that led into the cellar.
Janet pushed it open gently and slid down as
far as she could and then dropped.  It was very
dark and very musty.  She groped her way to the
rickety stairs as quickly as she could.  The door
at the top opened with a groan as she pushed, and
she was in a long, low-ceilinged kitchen.  Rain
had come down through the leaky roof and rusted
the stove, the furniture was covered with dust, and
a forlorn china cup with its handle broken lay
dejectedly on one corner of the table.
</p>

<p>
Janet glanced hurriedly about her, to make sure
that no one had been in the room since she had,
and then hurried into the front hall.  Some heavy
pieces of furniture were partly covered by torn
and dirty sheets; they looked like ghosts in the
dim light that filtered in through the boarded
windows.  Janet, in spite of the many times that she
had passed them, could not repress a shiver, and
she gave a sigh of relief as she closed the door of
another room behind her.  She was in her kingdom
at last, and she surveyed it with sparkling
eyes.  It was a long room with a low ceiling that
ran the length of the house.  In the center along
one side was a huge fireplace.  Each one of the
six windows had a broad window seat.  There
was very little furniture, and none of it was
covered by dust sheets.  In consequence, the stuffing
was coming out of several of the chairs and a
puddle of water had sopped into the big horsehair
sofa.  The only human looking thing in the room
was a pair of gloves on one end of the table.  They
were badly mildewed and they looked very limp
and lifeless, but they had belonged to some one
of the mysterious owners of the house, and Janet
always nodded to them with mock respect.  It was
the books that made the room a kingdom.  Rows
and rows of them lined the walls from floor to
ceiling.  Some of them were damp and moldy but they
were all readable, and that was all that mattered
to Janet, though she sometimes cried over a
broken binding and patted it quite as she would
have stroked a hurt puppy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my darlings, I have come back to you,"
she said as she slipped to her knees before a
corner bookcase, "and I want you to be very kind to
me and take me far, far away to&mdash;"  She let her
hand wander over the backs of the books until it
rested on one, "Greece," she finished, as she read
the title.
</p>

<p>
She made herself as comfortable as possible
in one of the window seats, and for an hour she
was so engrossed in the old fables and the stirring
tales of the gods that she forgot the time.  It was
only when the light through the chink of the boarding
grew too dim to see that she realized with a
start that it was getting late.
</p>

<p>
"And I never looked up about Roy's paw in that
animal book!" she exclaimed.  Had Mrs. Page
heard her, she might have understood where she
had learned so much about the care of dogs.
</p>

<p>
Janet hurriedly put her book back and went to
the bookcase across the room to find what she
wanted.
</p>

<p>
"That's funny," she said.  "I thought I left
it&mdash;why, I did; here's the place where it belongs."  An
empty hole on the bottom shelf confronted her,
and looked as if the smiling row had lost a tooth.
</p>

<p>
Without exactly knowing why, Janet was frightened.
She had looked upon this room as so
particularly hers for so long that there was
something uncanny in the thought that some one else
had dared to trespass.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I put it back somewhere else."  She
tried to comfort herself with this thought, but she
could not get rid of the queer feeling that some
other hands were touching her loves, and that
other eyes were seeing into her enchanted pages.
</p>

<p>
She puzzled over it as she rowed home, but it
was impossible to come to any conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Martha was waiting for her in the hall; her
face was even whiter than it had been earlier in
the day.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Janet, you're back, thank goodness;
your grandmother has been calling for you all
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"When did Mrs. Todd leave!" Janet enquired.
</p>

<p>
"She hasn't left at all," Martha gasped.
"She's sat in there the whole blessed day.  Only
an hour ago she came into my kitchen as smiling
as you please, and said she and Mrs. Page would
have a cup of tea and some toast and jam.  I took
it in, and, well, Miss Janet, it's beyond me; indeed
it is!"
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, why shouldn't they have tea?
Grandmother always has it for her guests."  Janet
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Martha sighed profoundly.
</p>

<p>
"If you knew all that I know of those two and
then to see them smiling and laughing together,"
Martha shook her head, unable to give vent to her
feelings in mere words.
</p>

<p>
Janet raced upstairs and changed her dress,
and in a very few minutes she was knocking at her
grandmother's door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's you, is it, dear child!" Mrs. Todd
called as she entered.  "I was hoping you would
get back in time to drive me home."
</p>

<p>
"Ann, don't presume too far," Mrs. Page said
tartly.  "Janet, where have you been?"
</p>

<p>
Janet decided that the change in her
grandmother was not as great as Martha had led
her to suppose, so she answered as she
always did.
</p>

<p>
"I have been out most of the time."
</p>

<p>
"To whom are you speaking!" Mrs. Page inquired.
</p>

<p>
Janet sighed and blushed a little; it was not like
her grandmother to find fault before people.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, 'I have been out most of the time,
grandmother,'" she corrected, but a second later
she almost laughed aloud for she was sure she had
heard Mrs. Todd say "fiddlesticks" under her
breath.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted you all afternoon," Mrs. Page went
on.  "However, we will let that pass.  Mrs. Todd
wishes you to help this year at the church fair
and I have given my consent under one
condition&mdash;that you are home here by nine o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Ten," corrected Mrs. Todd crisply.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, Ann?" Mrs. Page's eyes
flashed.
</p>

<p>
"I said ten," Mrs. Todd repeated.  "Ten was
the hour we agreed on.  And now I must be going,
as my eyes are not what they used to be and these
new roads puzzle me.  I must ask you to let Janet
drive me home."
</p>

<p>
For a long minute there was silence, and then
Mrs. Page did something she was rarely ever seen
to do; she smiled.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
For a long minute there was silence, and then Mrs. Page <br>
did sometning she was rarely ever seen to do; she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You are a very smart woman, Ann Todd, and
I'm a very old one.  Have your own way, but
remember your promise," she said.
</p>

<p>
The drive through the twilight was wonderful,
for Mrs. Todd let Janet do the driving while she
sat back and talked.
</p>

<p>
"You're a funny youngster," she said when
they were half way to the village.  "You haven't
asked me a single question."
</p>

<p>
"About grandmother, do you mean?" Janet
laughed.  "I didn't have to.  You see, you made
her let me go and that's all that matters."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't aren't you curious to know how?"
</p>

<p>
Janet shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you.  I bullied her.
</p>

<p>
"Your grandmother is a very remarkable woman,"
she added after a silence that lasted until
they were turning into the driveway of the
rectory grounds.
</p>

<p>
"I think she is too," Janet said loyally, "and
every one is sure to like her when they know and
understand her."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd got out at the carriage block.  "Bless
the child," she said almost tenderly, but a second
later, as she was going up the steps, she said in
her usual brisk manner, "Come 'round to-morrow
and see me; we'll have a chat."
</p>

<p>
Janet gave the horse over to the hired man and
walked slowly home.  She was so absorbed in her
thoughts that she reached the end of the garden
wall before she knew it.
</p>

<p>
The sound of an automobile made her hurry to
the side of the road.  Motors were not very
common in Old Chester, for it was away from the
beaten track and the roads were very bad.  Janet
was a little ashamed of her interest in them, but
she could never resist staring at them.  The one
that was approaching now had powerful searchlights,
and she watched them, fascinated.  It
looked as though they were sweeping right on to
her very feet.  Suddenly they fell across the
corner of the garden wall.  It was only for a minute,
but it was long enough to illuminate a patch of
ground and to bring out into sharp relief a torn
straw hat and a thick book bound in dull blue,
embossed with a gold dog.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS
</h3>

<p>
"My dear, you look tired out!" Mrs. Blake
exclaimed the next morning, when
Janet, very flushed and blown, presented
herself at the rectory.  "What have you
been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's an awfully windy morning, but I'm
not really tired," Janet replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's blowing a gale and it must be hard to
walk," Mrs. Blake agreed.  "It's bad enough
down here, but it must be dreadful up at your
house.  I can't be glad enough that we are not on
the shore; the sound of the waves would depress
me so," she added as she gave a little shudder and
held the door open for Janet to come in.
</p>

<p>
Janet did not bother to tell her that she had
battled with those same waves in a leaky boat not
half an hour ago, for she knew Mrs. Blake would
not understand the importance of replacing a
certain book in a certain shelf, nor would she see
anything funny in the sight of a torn straw hat lying
beside a pair of old gloves.  But Janet had a very
vivid imagination, and she had rowed over that
morning to the Kingdom in order to replace the
animal book and further to confuse the mysterious
boy, she had left his hat on the library table.  Her
only regret was that she would not be there to see
his expression when he found it.  There could be
no doubt now that he knew the secrets of the
deserted house&mdash;the hat and book proved it.  But
Janet, remembering the look in his gray eyes and
the way he had patted Roy, could not find it in
her heart to be angry.
</p>

<p>
A bright fire burned in the rectory living room,
and Alice and Mildred were sitting beside it.
They were still working over the green bunting.
</p>

<p>
Janet's heart sank.  She hated to sew, for her
fingers, in spite of Martha's patient teachings,
insisted on acting like thumbs.
</p>

<p>
"What would you like to do, my dear?" Mrs. Blake
inquired sweetly.  "Will you help the girls
or would you rather do something else?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll do whatever you like," Janet said
hesitatingly, "but I think perhaps I could do
something else better than I could sew.  I'm not very
good at sewing, you see."
</p>

<p>
Alice and Mildred looked up in shocked surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like to sew?" Mildred said incredulously.
</p>

<p>
Janet flushed.  "No, I don't," she said bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"How odd!" Mildred and Alice exclaimed
together.  "We love it."
</p>

<p>
"Daughters!" Mrs. Blake warned, for she had
caught the suggestion of scorn in their voices, and
she was quick to notice Janet's flush.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door from the dining-room
opened, and Mrs. Todd entered.  Her cheeks were
flushed, and her narrow little eyes seemed brighter
than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Morning everybody," she greeted, smiling at
Janet.  "You look very cozy in here, but you also
look very stuffy.  What's the matter, Janet!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, only I'm afraid I'm not going to be
much of a help," Janet confessed.  "I don't like
to sew, you see."  Janet always said "you see"
when she was embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Neither do I,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd laughed.  "Had
to do too much of it when I was a child."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we can find something else for Janet
to do," Mrs. Blake interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, we can.  Come with me,
Janet.  We'll rig up the fishing pond."
</p>

<p>
Janet waited until she was well away from the
library before she asked what a fishing pond was.
She was used to doing all the explaining and all
of the leading when it came to playing with other
girls, she had played so seldom with them, and
this new and scornful attitude of the Blakes made
her unreasonably angry.  She knew that if she
were competing in climbing trees or rowing&mdash;anything
that took courage&mdash;she would be their
superior.  But when it was a question of sewing,
she had to admit herself beaten.  The thought
made her very unhappy, for above everything
else in the world Janet wanted to be like other
girls.  Not the Blake girls, but the girl heroines
she had read of and dreamed of as friends in her
Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd noticed the worried expression on
her face and did her best to dispell it by giving
her something else to think about.
</p>

<p>
"A fish pond," she explained in answer to her
question, "is a very easy way of making people
spend money.  You put up a screen and sell little
wooden fish poles for ten cents.  The buyer goes
fishing over the screen and some one ties a
present to the end of the line."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd watched Janet closely, and laughed
with delight as the frown deepened on her
face.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she inquired, "what do you think of
it!"
</p>

<p>
"Not very much," Janet answered truthfully.
"Isn't there a better way?"
</p>

<p>
"I should think there would be,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd
chuckled.  "If you can suggest one we'll change
it and surprise them all."
</p>

<p>
"Why not let them really fish?"
</p>

<p>
"In water!  What would you have them catch?
Pincushions and tidies wouldn't be improved by a
ducking."
</p>

<p>
Janet thought for a minute.  They were in the
Sunday-school rooms, and she was sitting perched
up on the high platform.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't they catch things that come from
the sea!" she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"What, for instance!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shells and coral and fishes and stones.
They are every bit as sensible as pincushions and
so much prettier."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt about that,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd laughed&mdash;"but
where shall we get them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we have just loads of them up in the attic;
queer old shells from all over the world that my
great-grandfather, I think it was, brought home
with him."
</p>

<p>
"But, my child, you can't give those away,"
Mrs. Todd protested.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Your grandmother&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she wouldn't mind; she can't bear them.
You know, she hates anything that reminds her
of the water."  Janet looked at her companion
wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Queer, isn't it?" she said.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd looked at her with a peculiar light
in her steely eyes.  "Not under the circumstances,"
she said softly, but though Janet waited
she did not say any more.
</p>

<p>
"I asked grandmother once, oh, long ago, if I
might play with those shells,"&mdash;Janet returned
to the subject in hand&mdash;"and she said I might do
anything I liked with them as long as I kept them
out of her sight."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd seemed to consider the idea.  Finally
she said,
</p>

<p>
"Well, bring them along with you this afternoon,
and if they are of no value we'll use them
and surprise the neighborhood."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"They certainly are beauties," she said, when
after luncheon Janet had returned with a box full
of queer old shells and rough bits of coral.
</p>

<p>
"They must have come a long way, to judge
by the looks of them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think my great-grandfather used to
sail all the way 'round the world," Janet replied.
"Do you think they will do?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd looked at her.  "Do, child!  Why,
they will cause so much excitement that our booth
will be by far the most popular.  The only reason
I hesitate is that I am afraid that some day you
will be sorry you were so generous."
</p>

<p>
"But how silly,"&mdash;Janet laughed.  "These are
only a few of what we have.  There are heaps
left in the attic."
</p>

<p>
"Settled,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd laughed.  "And now,
Miss Original, will you please tell me what other
ideas you have lurking in the back of your brain?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you're teasing,"&mdash;Janet laughed.
"There's nothing else to think of, except the pond
itself, and that ought to be easy.  A big tub of real
sea water with pebbles and sand banked around
it, and perhaps we could borrow some of
Mrs. Blake's palms.  She has so many, and, oh, well,
we can make it look&mdash;now, you're laughing at
me."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," Mrs. Todd denied emphatically.
"I am laughing with you, and there's all
the difference in the world between the two.  But
I would like to know just where you got all your
imagination."
</p>

<p>
For a minute Janet was tempted to tell the
secret of the Kingdom, but with a start she realized
that it was no longer just her secret alone
and that in telling it she would almost be guilty
of betraying a confidence.
</p>

<p>
The Sunday-school room was gradually filling
up with people.  Janet knew them all and bowed
politely to each in turn.  For the most part the
women from the farms, who were bringing in their
donations of pies and cakes, stared at her with
ill-concealed curiosity.  Although she did not know
it, Janet was often the topic of conversation and
gossip at sewing bees.  Women with daughters
often spoke of her as "that poor lonely child,"
and thought of her as different from other girls.
It was a decided shock to see her in eager
consultation with Mrs. Todd&mdash;a most important
person&mdash;her cheeks ablaze and her eyes sparkling,
and having quite as good a time as any ordinary
girl; and acting for the most part with far less
affectation than their own children.
</p>

<p>
But though Janet did not show it, she was
conscious of the eyes upon her, and it did make
her uncomfortable.  She was very much relieved
when Mrs. Todd stopped in the middle of a
sentence and said:
</p>

<p>
"Stuffy; let's go out and see about finding our
landscape."
</p>

<p>
Once outside, Janet drew a breath of relief.
Harry Waters was passing, and she hailed him
with so much enthusiasm that he decided that he
was forgiven and he responded joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Want to help me this afternoon?" Janet
inquired.  "I want a big box of sand, and Mrs. Todd
says we may drive her horse and cart to the shore.
You get a box," she directed in her old manner.
</p>

<p>
Harry was too delighted to be back into favor
again to make any objections and dashed off at
once.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd nodded her head slowly and laughed.
"Boys are better fun than girls, eh?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Heaps," Janet replied, as she disappeared
into the barn to assist in the harnessing of
Durward, Mrs. Todd's horse.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE FAIR
</h3>

<p>
The Sunday-school room was packed with
people, but to an observant eye it was
noticeable that the greatest number were
in the corner under a silk canopy that looked like
an Arab's shelter.  Hanging beside it on the wall
was a sign, printed in orange and blue, that read,
</p>

<p class="t3">
  COME AND FISH<br>
  IN THE INDIAN OCEAN<br>
  A SURPRISE FOR EVERYBODY<br>
  10 CENTS A LINE<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Beyond the tent a group of high palms pointed
the way to the beach, where a huge tub filled with
water and reflecting myriads of little pebbles was
surrounded by a stretch of sand.  Sticks with
strings and hooks attached stood ready, and to
one side a mysterious mound covered by a silk
scarf invited the curiosity of the passersby.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd stood a little to one side and kept
looking at her watch.  Mrs. Blake came over to
her, and it was plain to be seen that they were
both worried.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose is keeping her?" Mrs. Blake
exclaimed.  "It is after four o'clock, and
we must begin with the pond.  Really, I think it
is most inconsiderate of her to keep us waiting.
Of course, if Mrs. Page has changed her mind&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mercy Page never changed her mind in her
life," Mrs. Todd snapped.  "It is something very
different than that, and I have a strong suspicion
what it is."  She looked at a group of giggling
girls who were whispering to each other in one
corner, and had one of them turned at just that
moment they would have wanted to run away,
for Mrs. Todd looked very stern and forbidding.
</p>

<p>
"Let some one else start it," she said.  "I'll
help them; she may come after all; who knows."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Janet at that particular moment was rowing
with all her might, and she was rowing in the
opposite direction from the church fair.
</p>

<p>
Something glistened in both of her eyes and
she stopped every now and then to brush it away.
Nothing in the world could have induced her to
turn around.
</p>

<p>
She was hurt and very angry, and the one
thought in her confused little mind was to forget
there ever was such a thing as a church fair.
</p>

<p>
This is what had happened.  Harry and she
had been busy in the early part of the afternoon
putting the finishing touches to their work, when
Janet found she wanted a pair of scissors.  A
number of girls were decorating a booth across the
room and she went over to borrow theirs.  She
was hidden from them by a curtain of bunting.
Just as she was about to speak, she heard one of
them say,
</p>

<p>
"I don't care if she is Janet Page, I don't like
her.  She's not a bit like other girls."  And
another voice answered, "I don't either; she's so
bossy."  "Plain stuck up," a third voice added.
</p>

<p>
Janet flushed crimson and fled.  Harry remembered
that she looked awfully queer, he said, when
he told Mrs. Todd later, "She said she was going
and not another word," he finished.
</p>

<p>
Janet had indeed gone.  She felt as though the
world was falling about her ears.  Try as she
could, she could not keep the hot tears from coming.
</p>

<p>
The brisk row did her good, and she started
up the sand dunes with her usual expectant step.
By the time she was in sight of the house, she was
laughing at herself.
</p>

<p>
"I may be different but I am not as bad as all
that, and besides I don't like those girls any
better than they like me, so we're even."
</p>

<p>
She decided to read about Mr. Micawber in
"David Copperfield."  He always cheered her up
when she was downhearted.
</p>

<p>
The quiet of the old house soothed her feelings.
She walked slowly around to the cellar window
and opened it softly.  Just as she was about to
slip through it, a piece of tin hit her sharply on
the nose.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p68"></a>
She jumped and looked up and directly into the
gray eyes of the mysterious boy.  He was sitting
on the edge of the sloping roof not fifteen feet
above her.
</p>

<p>
"Hurt you?" he called down.
</p>

<p>
"Not much," Janet answered, rubbing her nose,
for it smarted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it did; it's bleeding.  Say, I'm awfully
sorry.  Wait a jiffy and I'll be down."
</p>

<p>
He slid near the edge and jumped to the ground
almost beside her.
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other and then burst out
laughing.  Janet held her handkerchief up to her
face and regarded him over the corner of it.
</p>

<p>
"What were you doing up there?" she inquired.
"You nearly scared me to death."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was kind of scared myself," the
mysterious boy admitted.  "I was fixing the roof up
a bit.  It leaks onto the books now you know,
and I just happened to look down at you, I was
so surprised that I let the tin drop.
</p>

<p>
"I found my hat," he added after a minute, and
grinned sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever made you leave it by our fence?"
Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see me jump over your wall the other day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was bringing it to you then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And my dog barked at you."
</p>

<p>
"No,&mdash;that is, he did, but that isn't what scared
me.  Your dog and I are great friends.  It was
the woman that came out of the house.  I couldn't
explain before her so I bolted."
</p>

<p>
"Explain what?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to show you something about taking
a splinter out of a dog's paw and a way to put on
a bandage so that it won't come off."
</p>

<p>
Janet laughed, and he joined in.
</p>

<p>
"I was after the same book the other day and
I couldn't imagine who had taken it and then I
found it beside your hat and I knew you must
come here too."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been coming long?"
</p>

<p>
"Two years."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've been here six months, but I found it
the first week I was here."
</p>

<p>
"Where do you live?" Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
The boy pointed down the hill.  "At Vicker's
farm," he answered.  "I'm staying there all this
winter."  He laughed self-consciously.  "I'm
supposed to be weak or something, so Doc sent me
here."
</p>

<p>
"Who's Doc?" Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
"He was Dad's best friend, and now I guess
he's mine.  He sort of looked out for me after
Dad&mdash;after Dad went."
</p>

<p>
Janet looked up at him quickly, for his voice
had trembled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said softly.  "Let's go in
and look up that part in the animal book."
</p>

<p>
She started to slide into the cellar, but he
stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"I know a better way than that.  Come around
here."  He led her to the old porch and took
down two boards from one of the windows.  Janet
crawled through and found herself in the Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is a lot better.  Wonder why I never
thought of it.  It saves going through the spooky
kitchen, and I just perfectly hate that ghostly
hall."
</p>

<p>
They sat down together on the floor and were
soon engrossed by the book before them.  From
discussing dogs and horses they turned to other
subjects, and before she realized it Janet was
telling him why she had not gone to the fair.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him after she had finished.  He
was frowning.
</p>

<p>
"It was rough, I'll grant you," he drawled
slowly, "but you should have stayed and faced
the guns.  There's never any sense in running
away."
</p>

<p>
Janet felt very much ashamed of herself all at
once, and a dozen reasons why she should have
stayed rushed into her mind.
</p>

<p>
"It was cowardly of me," she exclaimed, "and
I'm going back this very minute."
</p>

<p>
"Good for you; it won't be much fun, but you'll
be glad you did it, I guess.  Say," he added after
a pause, "will you be back to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Will, if I can."
</p>

<p>
"And, say, you don't mind about my coming
here, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Janet had crawled through the window but she
called back over her shoulder, "No, I'm glad."  A
red head appeared in the opening.
</p>

<p>
"My name's Peter Gibbs," he called.
</p>

<p>
"Mine's Janet Page."
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Janet."
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Peter."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the people came back to the Sunday-school
room after the supper that had been served in the
gymnasium, many of them were astonished to
see Janet with Harry by the tent.  Mrs. Blake
was particularly so.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Janet, where have you been?  We were
so worried about you!" she exclaimed.  "And
what have you done to your nose?"
</p>

<p>
"I cut it, Mrs. Blake," Janet answered, "and
I am sorry to be late."
</p>

<p>
"Why, you poor child; what a pity.  It doesn't
matter at all about your being late."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Janet, we thought you were lost, but I
see you've found yourself,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd came up
and interrupted her cousin.  Janet looked at her
blue eyes and knew she understood something of
what she had gone through.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs. Todd," she replied gravely, "I
think I have."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
A STRANGER IN THE KINGDOM
</h3>

<p>
Janet halted in her climb up the steep bank
at the back of the deserted house and
smiled down at the ground.  The perfect
outline of a bare foot made a path ahead of her
straight to the steps of the porch.
</p>

<p>
It was one of the warm, golden days that come
sometimes in the fall, as though the summer,
being sorry to go, sent it to bid a last regretful
good-by.
</p>

<p>
A week had passed since the fair, and during
that time Janet had made many trips to her
Kingdom and she and Peter had become fast friends.
They read their favorite books aloud to each other
and played a game of "pretend" that would have
been impossible to two people who had not both
understood the meaning of loneliness.
</p>

<p>
To-day Janet found Peter deep in a thick,
uninteresting-looking book, but as she appeared in
the window he closed it and jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Princess," he greeted.  "I
thought you were never coming, I chopped wood,
fed the chickens and did all I could think of so
that I wouldn't be missed."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't get away a minute sooner,"&mdash;Janet
made a comical face.  "Mrs. Blake came to see
grandmother yesterday, and of course she had to
tell her that she was so surprised to learn that I
didn't like to sew.  Grandmother didn't say much,
but this morning she made me hem some dish
towels, for of course she knows I can sew passably
well when I want to.  Now she'll show them to
Mrs. Blake the next time she comes."  A note of
affection crept into her voice as she added,
"Grandmother's like that."
</p>

<p>
"What are you reading?" she inquired a minute later.
</p>

<p>
"A book about sheep," Peter replied.  "It's
kind of dull, but I like it.  I imagine sometimes
that I&mdash;" He hesitated and blushed.
</p>

<p>
"What?" Janet encouraged.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, anyway you'd laugh at me if I told
you."
</p>

<p>
"I would not!"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's just a crazy notion of mine, but I like
to think sometimes that I own this place, and then
I plan what I'd do with it, and one of the plans
is to turn it into a sheep farm,"&mdash;he laughed
nervously&mdash;"I guess I'd better stop dreaming though
and get to real work now."
</p>

<p>
Janet noticed that he laid stress on the word
"now," and she looked at him inquiringly.  He
pretended not to notice her.
</p>

<p>
"Peter," she said finally, "it isn't nice to be
mysterious.  What <i>is</i> the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
Peter ran his fingers through his red hair but
he did not reply.  Instead, he put the big book
back on its shelf and went over to the window.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully dark in here, don't you think?
And it's so bully out of doors.  Let's go fishing,"
he suggested.
</p>

<p>
Janet nodded.
</p>

<p>
"All right; we won't catch anything but it will
be fun anyway.  Come ahead."
</p>

<p>
Peter led the way toward the shore and up to
a dark green canoe.  Janet was properly excited;
she had never been in a canoe before.  None of the
girls she knew were at all interested in boating
except to go off in sailing parties for picnics, and
because the bay was very often rough and always
dangerous none of the boys were allowed to have
them.  She smiled as she remembered Mrs. Waters'
terror when Harry, the summer before,
had screwed up his courage to ask for one.  Yet
here was Peter acting as though the most ordinary
thing in the world was to go fishing in one.
</p>

<p>
"What a beauty!" she exclaimed.  "Is it yours?"
</p>

<p>
Peter shook his head.  "No, I found it over in
our barn and I asked Mr. Blunt if I could use it.
He didn't think much of the idea, but he said if
I could make it watertight I could have it and
welcome.  A summer boarder left it here a couple of
years ago.  Here you go; let me help you in.
Sorry I haven't any pillows," he apologized.
</p>

<p>
Janet looked up at him and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What under the sun would I do with a pillow?"
she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Stick it behind your back, of course.  It makes
it lots easier.  That is, most girls tuck 'em in all
around, and they seem to like it."  Peter sometimes
gave Janet a feeling that he was years and
years older than she by the way he talked of
things, people and places.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" she inquired as she settled
herself gingerly on the floor of the canoe.
</p>

<p>
"Seen them, by the dozens."
</p>

<p>
"Where!"
</p>

<p>
"Any place where there are canoes and
girls,"&mdash;Peter grinned.  "Dad and I always
paddled wherever and whenever we could, and we
used to laugh sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"What at?"  Janet was making no effort to
hide her curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Peter was busy turning the canoe around and
did not answer at once.  Janet watched him,
fascinated.  He paddled so softly and yet with so
much strength that they skimmed along over the
water as though they were flying.  Once out into
the bay and headed for the mouth of a small
creek, where Peter decided was the place to fish,
he returned to the subject.
</p>

<p>
"When I said just now we laughed," he
explained, "I was thinking of last summer.  Dad
and I took a trip up the Delaware River and of
course we passed lots of summer places on the
way, and we'd see fellows, about eighteen, out
with girls all dressed up and sitting all packed in
with pillows.  They looked all right, but I would
hate to have had them with us in some of the
storms we pulled through and some of the rocks
we had to pass."
</p>

<p>
"I see,"&mdash;Janet laughed, then she said hurriedly,
"Peter, what an exciting life you have had.
I wish you'd tell me some more about it."
</p>

<p>
Peter shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Not so very," he said; "you see there was
only Dad and me, and Dad was a civil engineer
and he had to be on the go most of the time.
Wherever there was a bridge being built or a
railroad put through or a dam built he was always
there, and so naturally I was too.  That is, I
shouldn't say naturally, because lots of people,
especially women, thought it was very strange,
but Dad said I was all he had left and he wasn't
going to have me shut up in a school where he
could never see me, so along I went, and I tell
you I had some grand old times.  But it's all over
now and I guess I'll go to work."
</p>

<p>
"Where!" Janet asked softly.
</p>

<p>
"Out West, I guess.  I like it out there, and
Dad knew a lot of ranch men that would give me
a job.  Dad always wanted me to be an engineer,
but that was before&mdash;"  In spite of himself his
voice broke a little, and he paddled with extra zeal.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Peter, I'm sorry."  Two big tears stood
in Janet's eyes.  "I wish I hadn't asked you so
many questions and started you remembering."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm always doing that anyway,"&mdash;Peter
tried to laugh.  "And I wanted to tell you about
Dad anyway.  Do you still feel like fishing?" he
inquired, abruptly changing the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Not 'specially," Janet admitted, "I'd rather
just paddle."
</p>

<p>
"Want me to teach you how!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, would you!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  Here, wait a minute and we'll land
and change places.  I wish I had another paddle,
then you could paddle bow."
</p>

<p>
The exchange of seats was made and the lessons
began.  Janet was an apt pupil, and Peter,
remembering his father's instructions of long ago,
did as well as instructor.  Black clouds rolled up
in the west without their noticing them, and it
was not until a faint peal of thunder sounded
that they realized that a storm was coming up.
</p>

<p>
"Queer at this time of year, isn't it?" Peter
asked, as Janet made for the bank and he took the
paddle again.
</p>

<p>
Janet shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"We have pretty bad ones sometimes in the fall;
sort of breaking up of summer, the fishermen say,
and to-day has been hot, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's no time to lose for it's coming
fast.  That creek's a bad place; the trees hide
the sky."  Peter took long firm strokes, and they
were soon out into the bay.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before the storm broke.  A
zig-zag of lightning and a sharp growl of thunder,
and then the rain&mdash;great drops of it.  The canoe
bobbed up and down, but Peter managed to send
it forward with every stroke.  Janet, though she
would never have admitted it, was thoroughly
frightened, and Peter, kneeling in the stern, very
calm and even smiling, began to assume in her
eyes the guise of a hero.
</p>

<p>
After several strenuous minutes that seemed
like as many hours they landed just below the
deserted house.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go up and wait until it stops," Peter
suggested as he turned the canoe over.  "You
can't possibly row home in this."
</p>

<p>
Janet nodded, and they trudged up the hill.
They were laughing when they reached the
window.  Once in the Kingdom with the rain shut
out, they felt very secure.  Peter pointed up to
the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't leak any more, thank goodness."
</p>

<p>
Janet felt her nose and smiled.  "Then I
don't suppose I ought to mind this," she said.
"It's still black and blue, and nobody can
understand how I ever managed to cut it just there."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't expect me to say I'm sorry."  Peter
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You might say that you wished we had met
under different conditions," Janet suggested, but
Peter wouldn't agree.
</p>

<p>
"It was just right the way it was," he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so; anyway we'd never have had
such fun together if we had been introduced.  Just
imagine, 'Janet, I want you to meet Mr. Peter
Gibbs'; how silly it sounds."
</p>

<p>
"Instead of 'Your royal highness, Princess of
the Enchanted Kingdom, allow me to introduce
myself, Lord Carrot Tops.  My calling-card is a
piece of tin, Bingo!  Of course I didn't say all
that but I thought most of it."
</p>

<p>
Peter laughed and Janet joined in.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway the tin calling-card part is true," she
said.
</p>

<p>
They both laughed on heartily and then stopped
short, their eyes on the doorway of the room.
</p>

<p>
A short fat little man, wearing a heavy gold
watch chain and an old fashioned soft black hat,
stood frowning at them.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
UNDER ARREST
</h3>

<p>
"Here's a pretty kettle of fish!" he
exclaimed, bobbing his head up and
down; "what do you mean breaking
into some one else's house like burglars?  Don't
tell me you were hiding from the rain for I won't
believe you."
</p>

<p>
Neither Peter nor Janet made any attempt to
tell him anything.  They were both too startled.
They stood frozen to the spot on which they stood.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to say, eh?" the old man went on in
his excited, squeeky little voice.  "Well, that's
just as well.  You'll come along with me now,
both of you."
</p>

<p>
"Are you the owner of this house?"  Peter was
himself again, and Janet marveled at the quiet
manner in which he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind about that; you'll soon enough
know."  The old man bustled toward them.  Peter
stepped in front of Janet.
</p>

<p>
"Are you the owner of this house?" he
demanded again.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, young fellow, don't give me
any of your impertinence, but come along quick."  The
quieter Peter's voice got the more excited
grew the little man.  "What are your names, eh?
Tell me that," he squeaked.
</p>

<p>
"We will do nothing of the kind," Peter said
firmly.
</p>

<p>
"What, what, what!  You tell me at once and
no more nonsense," the old man fairly spluttered.
</p>

<p>
"We refuse to tell our names to any one but
the owner of this house."  By now, Peter was
thoroughly enjoying himself, and he winked ever
so slightly at Janet.
</p>

<p>
Janet was chuckling to herself, but not at Peter.
She was wondering what would happen if she
did tell her name.  From past experiences she
knew that from blustering the old man would
apologize and offer to take her home.  But he might
insist on arresting Peter, and loyalty made her
keep silent.
</p>

<p>
The old man was getting very angry at Peter;
he even stamped his foot and his big gold chain
jingled.
</p>

<p>
"You come straight along and tell the owner
then," he exploded, "and you'll be sorry you
didn't tell me first.  I can promise you.  I'm a
sheriff, and you are both under arrest.  Now then,
what have you got to say?"
</p>

<p>
Peter and Janet looked at each other, and Peter
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We have nothing to say until we see the
owner," he said.
</p>

<p>
The sheriff turned on his heel.  They followed
him through the hall and out of the back door, of
which he had the key.  A buggy was standing in
the woodshed, and they all got in.  The rain had
stopped and soft mud spattered them as they
drove along.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully glad he isn't the owner," Peter
whispered in Janet's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so am I," she agreed, "but of course I
knew he couldn't be and look like that."
</p>

<p>
The sheriff did not notice them in any way.  His
ridiculous little fat face tried to look grim, but
only succeeded in looking funny.  He was thinking
very hard and wondering if the owner would
approve of his actions.  He had not bothered to
explain, when he said he was a sheriff, that he was
a retired one, without the slightest right in the
world to make an arrest.
</p>

<p>
"Where does the owner live?" Peter inquired,
breaking a silence that had lasted a mile.
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind where," the sheriff retorted;
"all that concerns you is that you will find the
owner at my house to-day."
</p>

<p>
Peter and Janet exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"We're in for it," Peter whispered, "but it
can't be very bad, and anyway we will see him
at last."
</p>

<p>
"I'm almost sorry," Janet sighed.  "He was
always such a thrilling mystery to me.  Do you
suppose those are his gloves on the library
table?"
</p>

<p>
Peter did not have time to reply, for they were
turning in at the gate of a big farm, and the
sheriff whipped up his horse to make a gallant
approach.
</p>

<p>
Once on his own land he regained his assurance,
and he opened the door of the tool house as though
it were a dungeon cell.
</p>

<p>
"You'll wait in here," he directed.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing else to do, so in they went,
and Janet heard the key grate in the rusty lock
with a queer sinking feeling.  But a look at
Peter's face made her swallow her fears and
manage a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose will happen next?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing very terrible," Peter assured her.
"You see, we never did any harm to anything,
and if we explain about the books, it ought to be
all right."
</p>

<p>
"That will depend on the owner,"&mdash;Janet's
voice sounded frightened in spite of herself.
"If he is nice, he will understand, and I suppose
he is if he owns the Kingdom; still, why doesn't
he live in it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's the mystery,"&mdash;Peter laughed.
"We will find out soon enough.  Mr. Sheriff is
probably telling all about us now, and I guess he
is not saying anything to help our case much."
</p>

<p>
Janet was silent for a minute, then she drew a
long heartfelt sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Peter, do you realize that we can never
go to the Kingdom again?  It isn't enchanted any
more; it's just a house that belongs to a man that
probably has a bald head and whiskers."
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't thought of that," Peter said gravely.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and the little man stood
before them again.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me," he said, and led the way to
the house.
</p>

<p>
"He's not nearly so starchy," Janet whispered;
"maybe he is nice after all."
</p>

<p>
"Of course he is," Peter assured her.
</p>

<p>
They passed through a big clean kitchen, full
of shiny pots and pans, and then into a dark
little hall.
</p>

<p>
"Wait here," their guide directed, as he shoved
them into a little room that looked like an office.
</p>

<p>
They waited, and a minute or two later the door
opened.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to say just what either Peter
or Janet imagined the owner of the deserted
house to resemble.  Janet, when she thought of
the place as belonging to any one but herself,
usually pictured a modern King Arthur who
would admit her claims as princess without
hesitation.  Peter knew that it was a house that his
father would have loved, and he thought of the
owner as a quiet gray-haired man in consequence.
They were neither of them prepared to see a
woman.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd!"  Janet after a stupefied second
fairly shouted the name, and it was Peter's turn to
be astonished.  He looked from one to the other
and blushed a little; he realized it might be
difficult to explain to a woman, for Peter knew
nothing about women.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd did not say anything.  She stood in
the doorway and laughed and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Is it really your house?" Janet stammered,
and she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's my house, and perhaps you can tell
me, for Mr. Simpson's benefit, what you two were
doing in it."
</p>

<p>
Peter looked at Janet, and she started the
explanation.
</p>

<p>
"We weren't doing anything just when he
found us," she said, "except waiting for the rain
to stop, but this wasn't the only time we've been
there.  You see, I found it first, oh, ages ago, and
I used to row over and read in the Kingdom&mdash;I
mean the library&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What did you call it?" Mrs. Todd interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that was just my name for it.  I always
thought of it as 'The Enchanted Kingdom'
because of all the wonderful books first and then
because it was so old and deserted and spooky."  Janet
looked at Peter and he nodded encouragement.
</p>

<p>
"I only met Peter the other day; it was the very
day of the fair.  I came over because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know; go on about Peter," Mrs. Todd put in.
</p>

<p>
"He was fixing the roof, and he dropped a
piece of tin down on my nose, and then, well, of
course we began to talk, and he said he had found
the books, too, and so we went into the Kingdom,
and it was Peter that made me go back to the
fair in spite of&mdash;"  Janet stopped, confused.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd surveyed the two before her.  There
was nothing left of her laughter but the tiniest
twinkle in her bright blue eyes.  She snapped
open her old-fashioned watch, looked at the time,
and snapped it shut again.
</p>

<p>
"It's late," she said.  "Janet, I'll drive you
home.  Where do you live?"&mdash;she turned to
Peter.
</p>

<p>
"At Blunt's farm.  I work there," he
answered her.
</p>

<p>
"Humm, well, you won't have far to go.  Good-by.
I'll see you again, and thanks for mending
my roof," she added, as Peter hurried to the door.
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her over his shoulder.  Janet went
with him as far as the gate.
</p>

<p>
"It's funny, isn't it!" she laughed; "and of
course she understands."
</p>

<p>
"Guess she does," Peter admitted.  "Good-by."
</p>

<p>
"Until next time," Janet added.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," Peter hesitated and then finished,
"Do you remember asking me what the matter
was this morning?  Well, it's this.  Doc is going
to Europe, and I won't let him leave me any money
'cause I know he needs it all himself, so I've got
to get work, and I think I'll be starting soon."
</p>

<p>
"But, Peter, I'll see you before you go," Janet
exclaimed in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," Peter drawled as he had done the
first time she had ever seen him.  "Anyway
good-by for now."
</p>

<p>
Janet watched him walk down the road until the
twilight shadows swallowed him up.  There was
something that felt like a lump in her throat.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE MYSTERIOUS OWNER
</h3>

<p>
"And now, you amazing child, tell me all
you know about Peter."  Mrs. Todd
let her horse trot along unguided
through the dusk and settled back in her seat, with
a look of amused expectation on her face.
</p>

<p>
Janet plunged into a recital of Peter's life, or
at least that portion of it that she knew, and
before very long the amusement changed to
interest and then to pity.  Mrs. Todd was a splendid
listener and a very understanding woman.
</p>

<p>
"What kinds of books does he like to read?"
she asked, when Janet paused for breath.
</p>

<p>
"Everything in the library," Janet told her.
"He laughs just as hard at 'Alice in Wonderland'
as he does over 'Robinhood and his Merrymen,'
but of course he likes Robinhood best, especially
the part about Little John.  He likes the 'Idyls
of the King' too, and he just eats up history.
To-day I found him reading a stuffy old book about
sheep.  I think he would like to raise, or do
whatever it is you do to, sheep, but of course he can't
now because of Doc."
</p>

<p>
"And who is Doc?" Mrs. Todd inquired.
</p>

<p>
Again Janet explained as best she could, and
this time it was Mrs. Todd's eyes that were wet.
</p>

<p>
"Hum," she said after a little pause, "perhaps
sheep would be a good idea, I never thought of it
myself.  I'll talk to Peter about it."
</p>

<p>
Janet sighed a long, happy sigh.
</p>

<p>
"It's the most perfect fairy tale that ever came
true," she said.  "Of all the people in the world
that I would have chosen to be the mysterious
owner of the Enchanted Kingdom, you would be
the first, only I simply can't understand why I
never knew or why you never lived in it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd sighed too, but hers was not a happy
sigh.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child," she said, "that is a very long
and a very disagreeable story, but perhaps I can
tell you enough of it for you to understand why
I left my home and Old Chester.
</p>

<p>
"When I was not so very many years older
than you, say about eighteen, your grandmother
decided that I was to marry your father Tom, and
my parents thoroughly agreed to the plan.  Your
father and I, however, did not.  In fact I might
say that we thoroughly disapproved.  We were
the very best of friends, but we were both in love
with other people; Tom with your beautiful
mother and I with Mr. Todd.  You know quite
well how your grandmother acts when anybody
goes against her wishes, so I need only say that
my father was just about as stubborn and they
had both determined on the match.  Now then! to
make a very long story short, I ran away with
Mr. Todd, and that made them both, your grandmother
and my father&mdash;my mother, bless her dear
heart, understood&mdash;very angry.  Your grandmother
said that I was never to enter her house
again.  I never did until the other day when I
went with you.  My father was just as severe
and told me that I could never come home with
my husband.  Well, of course, there was never
any idea of my returning without him, and so we
stayed away and traveled in every country under
the sun and had the happiest three years imaginable,
and then he died."  There was a long pause
before Mrs. Todd continued her story.
</p>

<p>
"I went home after that with my baby boy and&mdash;oh,
my dear child, you will think this a very
dismal tale, but it's best to finish it.  My baby
died the next year, and I left the house, I thought,
forever.  It was mine for my father had died the
year after my marriage and left it to me, but for
so many years I had been unhappy there that I
determined never to come near it again.  That
was thirty years ago and I have just come back.
</p>

<p>
"To-day I determined to go and see how the
old place looked, I was afraid it would be in ruins.
On my way I stopped in at the Simpsons and
there my courage failed.  So, I sent Mr. Simpson
up to look at it and see if there was any chance
of repairing it.  I thought perhaps if it were
patched up and swept out and tidied a bit it would
not be as hard to return.  Now I know I was a
very silly and sentimental old lady, and I will go
myself to-morrow morning and see about hurrying
up the work of repairs.  With two caretakers I am
sure it has not suffered too much."  Mrs. Todd
stopped as shortly as she had begun and picked
up the reins and chirruped to the horse, as though
to say the conversation was finished now and forever.
</p>

<p>
Janet knew it was, and without quite
understanding it she realized the effort it had taken
to tell it.  She wanted to say something to
Mrs. Todd, but she knew there was nothing that could
be put into words, so she sat silent for the rest
of the drive.  This was the second "story" she
had heard that day, and the combination of the
two opened up a world beyond Old Chester and
gave her a sudden glimpse of life, its sorrows,
its struggles, its joys and, above all, its victories.
The knowledge made her restless, but it made her
happy and above all expectant.
</p>

<p>
If big things happened to the Mrs. Todds and
the Peters in the world, surely big things would
come to her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd stopped at the garden gate of the
Pages and held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, child," she said.  "Don't think
too much of all I have told you, or, if you do,
remember this: no matter how much sorrow there
is in this old world of ours, there is never a
minute of it that is not worth the living.  And now,
good night; go to your Enchanted Kingdom whenever
you like, it is more yours now than it ever
was."
</p>

<p>
Janet held the big firm hand tight, but all she
could find to say was "thank you."  There were
a hundred questions that she wanted to ask, and
she finally found the words for the most important
of them all.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd," she asked softly, "did you know
my mother?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd looked at her intently for a long
time and then she looked at the light that always
burned in Mrs. Page's room.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my child, I did, and I loved her; but
then everybody did with the exception of&mdash;" she
hesitated; "no, that's not quite fair, so I won't
finish.  Some day, with your grandmother's
permission, I will tell you all I can about her, and
now hurry in and eat your dinner or Martha will
be having one of her nervous spells."
</p>

<p>
Janet laughed, and squeezed Mrs. Todd's hand
a little harder before she let it go.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she promised, "I just suddenly
realized that I am as hungry as a bear."
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Todd did something that would have
surprised her friends.  She leaned out of the
carriage and kissed Janet.
</p>

<p>
Martha was on the verge of a nervous spell,
Janet found her looking out of the front hall
window.  She tiptoed up behind her and said "boo."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Janet, you're home at last; wherever
have you been!" Martha exclaimed.  "I have
been worried to death over you out in that storm."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I wasn't out in all of it,"&mdash;Janet
laughed.  "I've been driving with Mrs. Todd."
</p>

<p>
"I might have known that," Martha said,
exasperation written large on her face.  "Ann
Hitchens was always one to upset things.  Here
we've been living in peace for years and the
minute she comes back, oh, deary me, everything's
a-flutter and topsy-turvy, I wish she'd go away
again, I do indeed."
</p>

<p>
"But she won't," Janet replied happily.  "She
is never going away again, and I am so glad I
could dance."
</p>

<p>
Martha sniffed, and when Martha sniffed it
was never necessary for her to put her meaning
into words.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't dance into your grandmother's
room," she advised.  "Walk like a little lady and
go at once.  She has been worrying about you
all afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Contrary to all expectations, Mrs. Page had
nothing to say about the lateness of the hour.  She
greeted Janet as usual, told her to wash her hands
and eat her dinner; then she turned her face to
the wall, her way of saying good night.
</p>

<p>
Janet was about to leave the room, but
something made her pause at the foot of the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Grandmother," she said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" Mrs. Page sat up and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Grandmother," Janet began again, "I am
sorry if I worried you by being out late."
</p>

<p>
"Who told you I was worried?" Mrs. Page demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Martha," Janet said.
</p>

<p>
"Martha talks too much," Mrs. Page snapped.
"I was worried, but you are back now so don't
talk any more about it."
</p>

<p>
Janet left the room, closing the door very softly
behind her.  In the hall she studied the grandfather's
clock with apparent interest, but it is a
question whether she saw it at all.  She was
realizing for the first time in her life that her
grandmother was a very old lady.
</p>

<p>
Martha called her, and she went in to her dinner.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
PETER
</h3>

<p>
Martha was cleaning house; rugs were
hanging in the kitchen yard and clouds
of dust testified to the strength of her
arm.  Indoors all the chairs were turned over,
and white sheets covered the rest of the furniture.
Janet and Boru fled to the "widow's walk" to
escape.
</p>

<p>
"I hate house cleaning," Janet complained; "if
I ever have a house of my own I will go away on
a trip and not come back until there's enough
dust to make things look comfy again."  Boru,
who had a marked respect for Martha's broom,
folded his paws over his nose and looked sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what will happen to-day," Janet
went on; "everything has been so exciting for the
last few weeks that I love to wake up in the
morning.  I wonder if it wasn't all a dream about
Mrs. Todd and that absurd little man and Peter.  I
don't really believe that I ever paddled that canoe
yesterday at all."
</p>

<p>
A whistle interrupted her musings, and she
leaned over the railing and saw Harry Waters
at the garden gate.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" she called.
</p>

<p>
It was a little time before Harry could locate
her, but when he did he beckoned.
</p>

<p>
"Come on down."
</p>

<p>
"All right, wait a minute,"&mdash;Janet sighed.
Harry was not the form of excitement she would
have chosen for the day, but he was better than
talking to Boru or listening to Martha's beating
the rugs.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," she greeted when she had joined him
in the garden.  "How's Roy?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's all right.  He caught a rabbit the
other day."  Harry bragged as though the credit
were his.
</p>

<p>
"I think that was horrid of him.  That's just
the trouble with those hunting dogs,"&mdash;Janet
flared up&mdash;"they are always catching some poor
little animal that never did anybody any harm.
If Boru ever did such a thing I would whip him
good and hard, I can tell you."  Boru hung his
head; no doubt the memory of countless innocent
rabbits weighed heavily on his doggish conscience.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, shucks," Harry grumbled; "that's just
like a girl.  They make a fuss and even kiss a
dog if it gets a splinter in its paw, but the minute
one does something worth while they want to whip
it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't like to think of a little dead
bunny.  They're so soft and snuggly,"&mdash;Janet
defended herself; "and I don't care who knows
it."
</p>

<p>
"Scared!"  The word was hardly out of
Harry's mouth before he regretted it.
</p>

<p>
Janet eyed him with so much scorn that words
were unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
"If I were you, Harry," she said at length,
but Harry interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know what you're thinking of, but that's
different," he protested; "my mother says so.
Anyway, I didn't come over here to argue," he
finished crossly.
</p>

<p>
Janet wanted to ask him what he had come over
for, but she was just a little ashamed of the way
she had been acting.  After all, Harry was an
old friend of hers, and it wasn't his fault that
he was fat and always complaining.  She gave
herself a little shake and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It is silly to scrap; let's go for a walk," she
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"All right, if you want to," Harry agreed, "but
I came over to tell you that there's a letter for
you at the post office, and Miss Clark says you
haven't been for mail for over a week, and there
are some letters for your grandmother and a
newspaper.  I'd have brought them to you but the old
crosspatch wouldn't let me.  She said I'd lose
them on the way, and she was responsible for the
U.S. mail.  I don't think much of Miss Clark
any&mdash;"  Harry stopped rambling, and stared at
Janet.  "Now what have I done!" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Janet marched off down the road, and he followed.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, but you're queer lately!" he grumbled.
</p>

<p>
Janet stopped to look at him.  Her cheeks were
bright red, and her eyes danced with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Harry Waters," she said, "if I were a dog
I think I'd bite you."
</p>

<p>
The rest of the way to the village Harry had
hard work keeping up with her.
</p>

<p>
At the post office, Miss Clark insisted on asking
innumerable questions about Mrs. Page.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't come for the mail for such a long
time that I said to my sister last night, 'I wonder
if Mrs. Page has had a turn,' so this morning I
told the Waters' boy to tell you that there were
several letters in your box&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"May I have them, please,"&mdash;Janet tried politely
to stem the tide, but Miss Clark did not
even notice the interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Time was when one letter a week was all most
folks looked for, but, lands sakes, nowadays with
all these advertisements and picture postcards,
your box is full before you know it.  Did you say
your grandmother was sick?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she is quite well, thank you.  Er&mdash;may
I&mdash;?" Janet tried again, and Miss Clark did walk
over to the box.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a blessing," she said over her
shoulder.  "I do think that when a body must lie
abed all day that they ought to have good health
except for that.  Now when my aunt Lucy&mdash;  Why,
I do declare&mdash;"  Miss Clark interrupted
herself this time&mdash;"I clean forgot to tell you there
was a letter for you.  It's from your brother.
Now that seems odd; he always writes to your
grandmother, but this certainly is for you.  I
can't imagine why it slipped my mind.  I've been
thinking about it all week."
</p>

<p>
"May I have it, please?"  Janet held out her
hand, and with apparent reluctance Miss Clark
gave her the little bundle of letters.  She took
them, said a hasty thank you, and escaped from
the post office before there was time for any more
conversation.
</p>

<p>
She studied the envelope with its Arizona
postmark and made sure that it was directed to her.
Then she tore it open to find a penciled note inside
that read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear little Firebrand sister of mine:</i>
</p>

<p>
"I am almost everything that you accused me
of being, except my appearance, and that is a
little better than you feared.  To prove it to you
I am going to come in person to see you and then
we can talk over all those worrying things you
spoke of.  Until I get there please try and think
a little better of me than you have through all
your short, little life, and please believe that I
am heartily ashamed of myself, but that I
solemnly promise to make up for it in the future.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your affectionate big brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"TOMMY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Janet read the letter over three times and then
she sat down on the carriage block and read it
again.
</p>

<p>
Harry watched her and shook his head.  He
had no doubts now that Janet was anything but
an ordinary, and by ordinary he meant queer
and unreasonable, girl.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what's the matter!" he asked again, this
time very forlornly.
</p>

<p>
"Matter?" Janet's laugh rang out happily.
"Not a single thing in all this wide wide world,
Harry!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Then what are you crying about?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Janet brushed away the two big tears that had
filled her eyes, and jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not crying, silly," she denied hotly.
"Anyway you wouldn't understand.  I'm going
home.  Good-by."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm darn glad I can't," was Harry's
parting, and he walked off in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
Janet read her letter all the way home.  It was
such a surprise, for she had quite given up all
hopes of ever finding the letter she had written
a month before.  She had never entertained the
idea of receiving an answer, and such an answer,
full of every sort of promise.  And he was
coming, and coming soon.  She consulted the
postmark and found that the letter had been in the
post office six days.
</p>

<p>
The sight of Martha still patiently beating rugs
was unbearable.  She hurried into the house and
took the rest of the mail to her grandmother.  As
she handed them to her, she saw to her surprise
that one of them was from her brother.  Perhaps
he was writing to tell her that he was coming
home, and that would make it unnecessary
for her to mention her letter.
</p>

<p>
"A letter from your brother," Mrs. Page said
solemnly.  "Please wait, Janet, and I will read
you what he says."  She opened the letter with
her customary precision and read it first to
herself.  Apparently she thought better of her
promise to read it aloud, for she folded it up and put
it back into its envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Your brother is well," she said at last, "and
he is coming home.  This letter is a week old
so that I imagine he will be here before long.
Please tell Martha not to make so much noise in
the hall and don't say anything to any one about
Thomas's proposed visit."
</p>

<p>
"But, grandmother, why in the world not!"
Janet could not help saying.
</p>

<p>
"Because I dislike gossip," Mrs. Page snapped.
"When he comes all the village will know it; that
will be soon enough."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandmother."  Janet left the room, but
she forgot to tell Martha not to make so much
noise.  The house was unbearable, and she
decided that even if she could not share her secret
with Mrs. Todd, it would be a comfort to go and
see her and talk about the Enchanted Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
She was hardly on her way with the idea fixed
in her mind when she heard horse's hoofs coming
toward, and after a minute she saw Mrs. Todd
in her carriage.  She stopped her horse at sight
of Janet, and beckoned to her.
</p>

<p>
Janet jumped in beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I was just coming to see you," she said.
"Have you been over to your house this morning!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd was plainly upset about something.
She was frowning, and there was not a spark of
fun in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No, child, I haven't," she answered.  "I went
over to find Peter early this morning, and the
Blunts told me he had gone away.  They said he
had told them that he was going west and that he
could not leave any address, but he left a letter
addressed to Dr. Peabody in Boston.  Now I
happen to know Jack Peabody.  He was a very dear
friend of my husband.  Of course I haven't seen
him in years but I am going up to Boston this
afternoon and give him Peter's letter, and
between us we ought to be able to find the boy.  It's
dreadful to think of his hunting for work and with
no money."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's splendid," Janet said shyly.
</p>

<p>
"That's because you are a silly, romantic child
with your head full of story-book nonsense,"
Mrs. Todd said briskly.  "What I wanted to see you
about was to ask you if that foolish boy gave you
any hint as to where he was going."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, he didn't," Janet said.  "I didn't
even dream he was going.  Oh, Mrs. Todd, do you
think you really can find him!" she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, child, don't worry your head
about it," Mrs. Todd comforted.  "Of course we
can.  Peter's hair is too red to allow him to run
away unnoticed."
</p>

<p>
Janet tried to smile, but it was difficult.  The
more she thought of Peter's going, the more she
realized how much she would miss him, and half
the joy in her brother's return was lost when she
realized that she could not introduce him to Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you could manage Clinker,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd
was speaking&mdash;"if you do I wish you
would drive over to Simpsons' this afternoon and
give him a letter for me."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I think I could drive him," Janet replied.
"I'll just let him walk and I'll be awfully
careful of him."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then, that's settled."  Mrs. Todd
spoke with her usual briskness, and a little of
the laughter returned to her eyes as she added,
"It will be a sorry dose for our friend the
ex-sheriff, but I think it will do him good."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
ANOTHER LETTER
</h3>

<p>
At two o'clock Janet was waiting in front
of the rectory.  She was to drive
Mrs. Todd to the station and then go on to
Simpsons' and deliver the letter.  Alice and
Mildred came out on the steps to see them off, and
their faces mirrored their thoughts.  Mrs. Todd
had never let them drive Clinker, and they could
not understand why Janet should be allowed the
privilege.  There was an air of mystery about
their cousin's sudden departure, and Janet
holding the reins and watching Clinker's ears
importantly added to it.
</p>

<p>
"When are you going to bring the carriage
back?" Alice inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I won't be late," Janet answered evasively.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd's "Hurry along now, child, or we'll
miss the train," put a stop to further questions.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope you won't be away very long," Janet
said softly when they were on their way.  "Something
exciting, that I can't tell you about, is going
to happen, and I think I will simply die if
you are not here."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, child, you sound mysterious,"&mdash;Mrs. Todd
laughed.  "Why can't you tell me about it?"
</p>

<p>
Janet did not reply; it would sound so rude to
say, "Grandmother won't let me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd understood her silence and laughed
again.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can see that I'll have to come back and
find out for myself then," she said; "when is it
going to happen?"
</p>

<p>
"Soon, I hope," Janet told her.  "It can't happen
too soon for me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Todd considered for a moment.  "Of
course I haven't the slightest idea when I will
come back.  It all depends on when we find that
boy.  Oh, but I shall give him such a talking to
when I find him.  Why couldn't he have waited
until to-morrow and saved all this fuss?"
</p>

<p>
"It was really to save fuss that he ran away,"
Janet reminded her.  "Poor Peter!  I just hate
to think that maybe he's hungry, but just the same
it was a splendid thing for him to do."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid, fiddlesticks!" Mrs. Todd ejaculated,
as they drew up to the station platform.
</p>

<p>
She said good-by very briskly, and Janet
watched her, preceded by a porter carrying her
bags, get into the parlor car.  Clinker did not
approve of the noisy engine, and she turned his
head and started off before the train pulled out.
</p>

<p>
It was a long drive to the Simpsons', and she
let the horse set his own gait, and so it was well
over an hour later before they reached the
Simpsons' place.  Janet, remembering the style in
which Mr. Simpson had driven in the day before,
touched up Clinker with the tip of the whip and
the cart swung into the gateway and rolled briskly
down the drive.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson came out of the barn at the sound
of Clinker's hoofs, and was as startled as Janet
could have wished.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Mr. Simpson!" she said in
her sweetest manner.  "I have a letter for you
here from Mrs. Todd.  She asked me to deliver
it to you."  She held out the envelope, and
Mr. Simpson, after carefully wiping his hands on his
overalls and finding his glasses, took it from her.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Mrs. Todd herself?" he asked sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"She had to go to Boston, so she won't be able
to come over to the house to-day," Janet explained.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson eyed her suspiciously, then he read
the letter.  Janet watched his face, and at the
sudden change of expression, she could not
repress a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Widow Page's granddaughter?" he
inquired at last.
</p>

<p>
Janet nodded and tried to look solemn.
</p>

<p>
"Did you and that boy from Blunts' know all
the time that the owner of that house was Mrs. Todd!"
</p>

<p>
This time Janet shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Did you have permission to go there when you
liked!"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Did you know I weren't no real sheriff!"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Weren't you scared!"  The question was
asked with so much anxiety, that Janet could not
find it in her heart to disappoint the little man
before her.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I was," she said.  "I was frightened
to death.  You see, you looked so very severe that
I thought at first you were the owner.  It was
lucky for us, wasn't it, that Mrs. Todd did own
it, for of course she didn't mind a bit."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson stroked his chin slowly and tried
to hide the smile of satisfaction on his round face.
</p>

<p>
"Waal," he said condescendingly, "I'm sorry I
scared you, though I must say neither of you
looked very frightened; but, you see, I had to do
my duty as a one-time officer of the State."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," Janet agreed.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll tell Mrs. Page that I am sorry
my duty lay in the direction it did," he continued.
"I wouldn't like to have her put out with me."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell her," Janet laughed, and added, as
she turned Clinker around, "I am going to the
house on the hill now, so please, if you happen in
as you did yesterday, ring the bell and let me
know you're coming.  I'd hate to be frightened
that way ever again."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson was now thoroughly sure that he
was not the object of ridicule, and he beamed upon
Janet and all the autumn landscape.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry, little lady," he chuckled;
"now that I know who you are I won't never
question your right to be any place in this county,
and any time I can do you a service you just call
on me and you'll find I'm your man."
</p>

<p>
Janet thanked him graciously and drove off,
without giving herself away by even a smile.
Once on the road and out of earshot, however, she
laughed so heartily that Clinker pricked up his
ears and started to run.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, old fellow, I didn't mean to
frighten you,"&mdash;she quieted him&mdash;"take your
time and do stop frisking.  It would be too awful
for words if you ran away and dumped me anywhere.
Think what Alice and Mildred would say."
</p>

<p>
Clinker obligingly settled into a trot, and they
were soon at the entrance to the Enchanted
Kingdom.  Janet had never before approached it from
the land side, and she was surprised at the broad
sweep of driveway before her.  The house and
barns looked more imposing from this side too.
</p>

<p>
"It is truly a fairy castle," she said aloud.
</p>

<p>
Clinker submitted to being tied under one of
the sheds, and Janet hurried around to the front
porch.  Mrs. Todd had offered her the key
Mr. Simpson had, but she had said she would rather
go in the old way.
</p>

<p>
Everything was very still, and somehow she felt
the loneliness of it all more than ever.  The roof
seemed to sag dejectedly, and a few dead autumn
leaves swishing in the wind against the front door
added to the unnatural dreariness.
</p>

<p>
She shivered a little before she slipped through
the window.  She wanted more than anything else
in the world at that moment to hear Peter's cheery
"hello."
</p>

<p>
Once in the library, she went straight to the
books and ran her hand over them as if to find
consultation in their worn backs.  She finally
selected a little book bound in red.  It opened
readily, more readily than usual, at a little poem.
Janet sat down on the floor and started to read
aloud to herself.  There was something in the
rhythm that always comforted her when she was
lonely.  Surely Mrs. Browning had understood
much when she wrote "Little Ellie."  Janet read
it idly:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Little Ellie sits alone<br>
  'Mid the beeches of a meadow,<br>
  By a stream-side on the grass.<br>
  And the trees are showering down,<br>
  Doubles of their leaves in shadow<br>
  On her shining hair and face.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "She has thrown her bonnet by<br>
  And her feet she has been dipping<br>
  In the shallow water's flow;<br>
  Now she holds them nakedly<br>
  In her hands all sleek and dripping<br>
  While she rocketh to and fro."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Little Ellie sits alone,<br>
  And the smile she has been using<br>
  Fills the silence like a speech,<br>
  While she thinks what shall be done<br>
  And the sweetest pleasure chooses<br>
  For her future within reach."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Many and many an afternoon Janet had read
the beginning of the little poem and then chosen
the sweetest pleasure for herself and lost the
rest of the day in dreams.
</p>

<p>
She looked up from the pages with a sigh, then
her eyes fell on a folded piece of paper lying on
the floor beside her.  She picked it up and opened
it.  Idle curiosity gave place to excited interest
as she read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear Princess:</i>
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to go away without another
good-by, but I must.  Doc was coming here to see
me, and I knew if he talked to me I would give
in and that wouldn't be fair to either of us, and
Dad would never approve.  I'm awfully glad you
know the owner of the 'E.K.,' for now I can
always think of you there.
</p>

<p>
"I left the canoe on the bank below your house,
and I rowed your boat back.  When I get a job
in the West I will write and tell you about it if
you want me to, and of course some day I will
see you again.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by again, and thanks for being such a
good little pal.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"PETER GIBBS."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Janet's eyes were blurred long before she came
to the end of the letter, and as she finished
reading two big tears splashed on to the book in her
lap.
</p>

<p>
She stood up and looked about the room forlornly;
the old gloves were gone from their accustomed
place on the table.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
JANET'S PASSENGER
</h3>

<p>
Janet left the house by the cellar window
instead of the easier way.  It would be
hard to explain her reasons, but it was
noticeable that when she had safely climbed out
and stood on the ground by the window, she leaned
over and picked up something and put it away
hastily in the pocket of her dress.  A great many
years were to pass before she showed it to
another soul.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Clinker," she said briskly, as she
went to the shed.  "It's high time we were
starting."  She jumped into the cart, and Clinker, only
too delighted to start for home, set off at a brisk
pace.
</p>

<p>
It was a long way by road back to the village,
and it was dusk before they neared it.  As they
came within sight of the railroad station Janet
heard a train pulling in, and remembering
Clinker's dislike for locomotives she slowed up to wait
until it left the station.
</p>

<p>
It was the train from Boston, and she could
not help wishing that Mrs. Todd and Peter were
on it.
</p>

<p>
When the last puff of the engine was lost in the
distance, she drove past the station very slowly.
Of course there was no sign of Mrs. Todd or
Peter, and she drove on, disappointed in spite
of herself.  A short stretch of wood made the
road quite dark ahead of her for a way.  Clinker
pricked up his ears as they entered it but Janet
did not pay any attention to him and was therefore
thoroughly startled when a voice, coming
apparently from nowhere, called:
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute there, will you!"
</p>

<p>
She pulled Clinker to a sudden stop and waited.
A man walked out of the shadows and came up
to the cart.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he said, taking off his
hat.  "I didn't see it was a lady driving."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but what difference does that make?"
Janet answered awkwardly.  "Won't I do?"
</p>

<p>
The man laughed and showed a set of the
whitest teeth Janet had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as a matter of fact," he explained in
his low voice, "I was going to ask for a lift."
</p>

<p>
Janet looked at him for a minute and decided
she liked him, and therefore it would not be
necessary to treat him the way she usually treated
strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't I give you one?" she asked,
laughing too.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, that's mighty nice of you, and I'm
very much obliged," he said.  "My bag is a little
too heavy to make walking any fun."  He got
in with surprising quickness, and Janet started
Clinker by a word.
</p>

<p>
"That's a mighty fine horse you've got there,"
he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, isn't he a beauty!  His name's Clinker,"
Janet replied.  "He doesn't belong to me, though.
I only wish he did."
</p>

<p>
They were out of the wood by now, and she
turned to look at her passenger.  He was, to judge
from the way he had to pull his knees up, a very
tall man and certainly he was handsome.  His
face was burned a dark tan, and his eyes were
set far apart and deep in his head.  His hat covered
most of his hair, but Janet knew it was brown
like his eyes.  There were lines at his temples
that proved, if proof were necessary, that he
laughed a good deal.  He had big broad shoulders
and nice long lean hands, that looked as though
he could do almost anything with them.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he asked, laughing, and Janet realized
she had been staring.
</p>

<p>
"I really couldn't help it, you see," she
apologized, very much confused.  "Why, I've
forgotten to ask you where you wanted to go?" she
added.
</p>

<p>
"To a hotel if there is one," the man replied.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but there isn't," Janet laughed.  "We
have a boarding house where most every one stays.
The post mistress keeps it, but I'm afraid you
won't like it very much."
</p>

<p>
The man considered for a minute or so, and then
smiled and shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"Then I must take the chance of being mistaken
for a tramp in these dusty clothes and go straight
home."
</p>

<p>
"Where's home?" Janet inquired.  "I don't
like to be inquisitive, but we are almost to Main
Street now."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, I didn't realize I hadn't introduced
myself.  I'm Tom Page; perhaps you know my
little sister Janet."
</p>

<p>
Whatever Janet did no one will ever know, but
Clinker, and he showed his disapproval of it by
almost jumping over the shafts.  If Tom had not
caught the reins and made him come to order he
might have succeeded in running away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, what happened?" he inquired,
when Clinker was walking quietly again.  "I
didn't see anything to frighten the animal, did
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I did it," Janet gasped.  "Can't you see!
I'm Janet, and you&mdash;oh, I know I'm dreaming."
</p>

<p>
"You!"  It was Tom's turn to be surprised.
"Why, you can't be.  Janet is just a youngster
and you are a very grown up young person."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm Janet just the same, and, well&mdash;how
do you do, Tom; I'm very glad to see you."  She
held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Bless your heart!"  Tom put his arm around
her and in spite of Clinker gave her a hearty kiss.
"What luck for us to meet like this!"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"and
I had pictured it so differently, and you
are just about fifty times as nice as I thought you
were going to be."
</p>

<p>
"Well," Janet sighed happily, "you certainly
are heaps nicer than <i>I</i> thought you were going
to be."
</p>

<p>
They turned the corner by the rectory, and
Clinker, without asking any one's permission,
turned in at the gate.
</p>

<p>
"We will have to leave the horse here," Janet
explained.  "He belongs to Mrs. Todd.  I was
just doing an errand for her."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd."  Tom was thoughtful.  "I seem
to remember her&mdash;oh, yes,"&mdash;and he laughed.
"I'd like to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"But she's in Boston," Janet replied.  "She's
only visiting at the rectory."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd better let me out anyway," Tom
suggested.  "I don't want to meet anybody
to-night.  You rustle along, and I'll wait here."  He
jumped out, and Janet hurried to the barn,
where the hired man was waiting to unhitch
Clinker.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Blake came out on to the back porch.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Janet?" she called.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs. Blake, I was a little delayed in
getting home.  I hope you haven't been worried,"
Janet replied.
</p>

<p>
"Only a little uneasy," Mrs. Blake confessed;
"won't you come in and see the girls?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not to-night, thank you.  I must really
hurry home."  Janet spoke with so much concern
that Mrs. Blake did not urge her, and after a
hurried good night she was able to join Tom.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite a long walk home," she apologized.
"I wish I could have driven all the way.  Won't
you let me help you with that bag!"
</p>

<p>
Tom laughed his hearty, good-natured laugh,
and caught his little sister by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"You little featherweight!  I could carry you
and the bag and never know you were there.  But
we'll take it easy, and that will give us more time
to talk.  First of all, how is grandmother?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's well; that is, of course, she is in
bed always, but I think she feels all right
otherwise," Janet replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course.  I was forgetting.  Let me
see, who else is in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, just Martha and me; that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Any friends?  Your letter sounded as though
you were lonely."
</p>

<p>
"I am sometimes," Janet confessed; "that is,
I used to be.  Lately I haven't had time because
there's been Peter and Mrs. Todd."
</p>

<p>
"Who's Peter?" Tom inquired.  "The boy
that was afraid of snakes?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," Janet denied hotly; "that was
Harry Waters."
</p>

<p>
Tom started to ask a question, thought better
of it, and said instead:
</p>

<p>
"How about girls?"
</p>

<p>
Janet did not reply at once.  Her own mind was
far from made up on the subject, and it was
difficult to answer Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know any girls, really," she replied
slowly.  "The ones I have met didn't like me
much, and I didn't like them.  When I wrote that
letter to you I thought I wanted a girl friend
more than anything else in the world, but now I
guess boys are better; anyway, they don't say
mean things behind your back."
</p>

<p>
"All girls are not alike, little sister of mine.
There are lots of girls in the world that are just
like you and you'd like them, even better than
you like boys."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, and finally Janet said:
</p>

<p>
"Tom, do you remember what I said in my letter
about wishing you were a sister instead of a
brother?"
</p>

<p>
"Even to the exact words,"&mdash;Tom laughed.
"You said that I would be much more of a
comfort to you as a sister.  That's what made me
come on at once.  I wanted to prove that brothers
are some use in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease," Janet begged.  "I only reminded
you of it so that I could say I was sorry."
</p>

<p>
"But you would like to have a sister too,
wouldn't you?" Tom asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course,"&mdash;Janet laughed.  "I'd like to
have one too, but not in place of you."
</p>

<p>
"Then <i>that's</i> all right,"&mdash;Tom gave her arm a
tight squeeze.  "Isn't that our house?" he
inquired, as the light from Mrs. Page's room
twinkled in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, but how did you know?" Janet
asked, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was ten years old before I left for
school," Tom explained.  "You were a tiny baby
then."
</p>

<p>
Janet lapsed into another thoughtful silence.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," she said seriously, "why didn't you
ever come back!"
</p>

<p>
Tom's voice was very gentle as he answered
her:
</p>

<p>
"That, little sister of mine," he said, "is one
of the many things I am going to tell you about
after I have talked to your grandmother."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE GREATEST SURPRISE IN THE WORLD
</h3>

<p>
Janet tiptoed down stairs and stole softly
out into the garden.  It was very early in
the morning, and even Martha was still
asleep.  But there was no sleep for Janet.  Her
eyes had been wide open since the first streak of
pale light had fallen slantwise across her floor.
For hours she had tossed restlessly, and at last,
unable to stand it any longer, she had dressed.
</p>

<p>
It was the morning after Tom's arrival.  Janet
thought over the events of the night before and
frowned.  As soon as they had entered the house
he had gone straight to his grandmother's room,
and she had not seen him since.  She and Martha
had sat up until after ten and then, very much
against her will, she had gone to bed and listened
for a long time to the murmur of voices in the
room below.  At first her grandmother's querulous
tones had predominated, but after a while
Tom's low rumble sounded comfortingly in her
ears, and she had slipped off to sleep.
</p>

<p>
This morning, as she thought about it, she tried
to imagine all that had been said behind that
closed door, but she found it impossible.  Why
there should be anything to discuss, she couldn't
imaging.  Other people lived without an air of
mystery surrounding them, and at this moment
of Janet's life she envied those people with all
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Once several years before she had asked her
grandmother to tell her about her mother and
father.  Mrs. Page had told her there was nothing
to tell, and had forbidden her ever to speak
of the subject again.  She had looked so gray
and sick as she said it that Janet had been
frightened, and she had never ventured to refer to it
again except to Martha, and all Martha could tell
her was that her mother had been a dear patient
saint and her father the finest man that ever lived.
Janet had tried to picture them from this description,
and up until a year before she had been contented.
Now she wanted to know more.  Mrs. Todd,
too, had made her think.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at Tom's window impatiently,
and as she looked the shade moved and Tom put
his head out.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he called down softly.  "I knew
you'd be up with the birds.  Wait a jiffy, and
I'll be down with you."
</p>

<p>
Janet threw him a kiss and told him to hurry.
She listened, smiling, as she heard him splash in
the bathtub.  It was not many minutes before he
was beside her, and they were seated on the old
stone garden bench.
</p>

<p>
"How is my little grown-up sister this morning?"
he inquired, as he kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy, please tell me everything," Janet
begged.  "I want to know so badly."
</p>

<p>
"Poor youngster,"&mdash;Tom patted her shoulder
affectionately&mdash;"so you shall, but first let me have
a look at you, I hardly saw you last night."  He
turned her face toward him and smiled down into
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Janet, what would you say if I told you that
you had a sister?" he asked slowly.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;why, how silly!  I wouldn't, believe
you,"&mdash;Janet laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Not if I told you quite seriously?"
</p>

<p>
Janet jumped up from her seat and faced her
brother.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy, what do you mean?" she asked wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Not only an ordinary sister," Tom continued,
"but a twin sister."  He studied her anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Janet was more bewildered than ever.
</p>

<p>
"But I couldn't have, Tommy, and not know it."
</p>

<p>
"It does sound unreasonable," Tom agreed,
"but it's true.  Do you want me to tell you about
her?"
</p>

<p>
Janet put her hands on his shoulders and looked
at him, still doubtful and a little frightened.
</p>

<p>
"You're not teasing me, are you?" she asked,
and her voice trembled.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-135.jpg" alt="&quot;You're not teasing me, are you?&quot; she asked, and her voice trembled.">
<br>
&quot;You're not teasing me, are you?&quot; she asked, and her <br>
voice trembled.
</p>

<p>
Tom stood up and put his arm around her, and
they walked slowly down the garden path.
</p>

<p>
"No, honey, I'm not teasing you," he said
quietly.  "Let me try and explain.
</p>

<p>
"I will have to say some things about grandmother
that I would rather leave unsaid, but you
must try and understand that although she is a
very unreasonable and selfish old lady she did
what she thought was right."
</p>

<p>
"Of course,"&mdash;Janet nodded her head.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that you must know all about mother
and father, I never dreamed she would refuse to
answer your questions, and of course I knew you
would ask questions as soon as you began to think.
I've been a very selfish brother and I am heartily
ashamed of myself, I should have come home ages
ago, but we'll let that pass now.
</p>

<p>
"You know Mrs. Todd?" he paused, and Janet
nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a long time ago grandmother decided
that she was to marry father, but father was in
love with mother then; very, very much in love
with her."  Tom smiled as he added, "And he
married her.  Grandmother was furious, but she
adored father and before long she forgave him
and he and mother came here to live.  I guess
grandmother had to like mother in spite of herself,
but she could never quite forgive her for not being
the girl she had chosen.  I was born, and then
ten years later you and Phyllis came along."
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis, oh, what a lovely name!" Janet exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"It was mother's name too," Tom told her, and
went on with his story.  "One day when you were
just tiny tots father and mother went out for a
sail.  It was windy, and grandmother tried to
persuade them not to go, but mother laughed at
the idea of danger and they went."  Tom paused
and stroked Janet's soft hair.
</p>

<p>
"They never came back, dear," he said gently.
After a little he went on: "When grandmother
heard it she almost lost her mind from grief, and
she was sick for a long time.  When she got better
she had a fixed idea in her head that it was
mother's fault and she would not let any one
mention her name before her.  Aunt Marjorie,
mother's sister, came down, and of course she
wanted to take you and Phyllis home with her,
but grandmother wouldn't let her.  She let her
have Phyllis, because she had been named for
mother, but she kept you.  Aunt Marjorie was
very angry and when she left grandmother told
her never to come back and never to write to you
or to me.  Of course there was nothing for Aunt
Mog to do but to agree.  However, she didn't
keep her promise, for she used to write to me at
school and send me all kinds of things to eat.  But
I never saw her.  Grandmother sent me away to
school, and because I was noisy in the house she
wouldn't let me come home for vacations.  I was
glad of it, for some of the boys always took me
to their houses and I had a much better time.
After I finished college I went west and for a
while I was so busy on my ranch that I forgot
I had any sisters.  I used to write to grandmother
now and again, as you know, and I sent my love
to you, you were quite right to object to that kind
of love," he added, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"But how could you tell I wasn't the horrid
prim thing that wrote those letters that
grandmother corrected,"&mdash;Janet was quick to defend
him against himself.  "Did you ever write to
Phyllis!"
</p>

<p>
"Only at Christinas and after a while I
stopped doing even that.  She was just a little
kid and I was so far away.  Aunt Mog writes me
whenever they move and change addresses.  Bless
her heart, I shouldn't wonder if perhaps she'd
guessed that some day we would all want to be
together.  You'll love Aunt Mog; she's a dear."
</p>

<p>
Janet walked back to the bench and sat down
limply, her knees felt shaky.
</p>

<p>
"A sister," she said softly.
</p>

<p>
"A twin," Tom corrected her, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"It's the same thing, only better," Janet
answered, and then she laughed too.  "Oh, Tommy,
I'm so happy I think I'm going to cry like an
idiotic baby."
</p>

<p>
"Cry ahead, I won't look," Tom promised, but
Janet had too many questions to ask to waste
time crying.  She swallowed hard, gave herself
a little shake, and no tears came.
</p>

<p>
"Am I going to see Phyllis soon?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Just as soon as I can get ahold of Aunt Mog
and arrange for them to come down," Tom
assured her.
</p>

<p>
"Come down!" Janet exclaimed.  "Will grandmother
let them?"
</p>

<p>
Tom smiled a peculiar sort of a smile.  "Grandmother
is going to <i>ask</i> them to come down," he
said quietly.
</p>

<p>
Janet looked at him in amazement.  It was
hard to imagine her grandmother's giving in to
anybody, but it was harder still to look at Tom's
mouth and imagine anybody not giving in to him.
</p>

<p>
As they had talked, Martha had been busy about
the kitchen, and the sound of pots and pans and
running water reached the garden.  Finally Tom
sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"Muffins," he exclaimed, "and I am as
hungry as a bear.  Come along and let's find
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Martha's excitement and bewilderment were
such that it is a wonder everything was not burned
for breakfast, but her ability as a cook was greater
than any temporary shock, and the breakfast
was delicious.
</p>

<p>
Tom and Janet did it full justice.
</p>

<p>
"It is such fun to have some one at the table
to talk to," Janet said, and Tom had a sudden
vision of her sitting alone year after year in the
big dining-room, and once more he called himself
a thoroughly selfish brother and choked a little
over his coffee.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast Janet went to her grandmother's
door and knocked as she had always
done.  It was all a little different this morning
and she hesitated a second on the threshold before
she went in.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Page, propped up as usual by countless
pillows, looked smaller and older than ever, and
any feeling of resentment that Janet may have
felt disappeared and an understanding sympathy
took its place.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, grandmother?" she said as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen your brother?" Mrs. Page
asked a little shakily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandmother, and he told me
everything."  Janet spoke very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what have you to say about it?  Come,
speak up," Mrs. Page fidgeted with the bed
clothes.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't anything to say," Janet answered.
"Of course I am awfully glad really to know
Tom and I want more than anything in the world
to see my sister."
</p>

<p>
"You do, eh?  Very well, you shall; but if you
don't like her, don't blame me.  I've tried to keep
you away from unhappiness but now you may do
as you like."
</p>

<p>
Janet thought of the lonely yet happy years,
and she laid her hand on her grandmother's that
was nervously stroking the sheet.
</p>

<p>
"I know you have, grandmother, and I am very
grateful, truly I am; and of course I will love
Phyllis," she added with a gay little laugh.
</p>

<p>
Tom was waiting for her in the garden with
Boru.
</p>

<p>
"Let's take a walk down to the village.  I want
to send off a wire and then you can show me the
sights," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take you over to the big house on the
hill,"&mdash;Janet was eager to be off.  "Get your hat
and let's start this minute.  Oh, dear, I've so
many things to ask you and twice as many to tell
you."
</p>

<p>
"Thirteen years' worth,"&mdash;Tom laughed, and
they set off.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious day, the wind blew the red-brown
leaves in graceful swirls, and the sunshine
melted everything to a misty gold.
</p>

<p>
It was surely a never-to-be-forgotten day in
Janet's life.  Tom told her thrilling stories of
the West and his own ranch, and in return she
confided all her secrets.  He was interested,
especially in Peter, for he had heard of his father.
He blessed Mrs. Todd secretly for her interest
in Janet, and his wish of the night before to meet
her took on a new significance.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day the "thirteen years" had
very nearly been bridged, and Tom's admiration
for his little sister was only equalled by her love
for him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Janet," he said half seriously,
as they climbed the steps from the shore, "I'm
not nearly as sorry as I was that I have neglected
you for so long.  Left to yourself you have certainly
made a very acceptable little sister, and
think how badly I might have spoiled you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do stop blaming yourself," Janet cried;
"what is the use of thinking about anything that
is farther back than last night or perhaps two
weeks ago?" she corrected herself, thinking of
Peter and Mrs. Todd.

<h3>
XIV
<br><br>
A LONG DAY
</h3>

<p>
Some one was tapping the knocker on the
porch below, and Janet stopped in her work
to listen.  It was an unfamiliar sound, for
most callers came to the house by way of the garden.
</p>

<p>
She tiptoed to the window and looked down.
Alice and Mildred Blake stood below her.  She
could see the tops of their brown felt hats.  A
minute later she heard Martha let them in, and
then call her from the foot of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
She looked about her in dismay.  She was getting
the front room ready for Phyllis and Aunt
Mog, and she did not want to be disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Janet," Martha called again, and this
time Janet answered.
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute, Martha; I'll be right down."  She
flew to her room and brushed her tossled hair
and took off the huge apron of Martha's that she
was wearing.
</p>

<p>
Alice and Mildred came forward to meet her
together.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Janet!" they exclaimed in chorus, "we
have just heard that your sister is coming.  Isn't
it exciting!  Miss Clark told mother, and she sent
us over to ask you if you wouldn't bring her and
your aunt&mdash;mother used to know her when they
were girls&mdash;to tea just as soon as they come."
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's awfully nice of you,"&mdash;Janet was
a little taken back.  "I'd be glad to."
</p>

<p>
"When are they coming?" Alice queried.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," Janet told them.  "Tom went
to New York last Monday and he sent me a
telegram saying they would all be here to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so Miss Clark said."  Mildred did not
try to conceal the fact that her sister's question
was asked purely to make conversation.  The
date and hour had been circulated freely about
the village as soon as Tom's wire had arrived.
</p>

<p>
"How is Mrs. Todd?" Janet asked, to save
Alice further embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
The girls exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"It's lucky you spoke of her or we might have
forgotten to give you a message she sent you in a
letter to mother," Mildred said.  "She said to
tell you that you could drive Clinker any time you
liked and that she would be very glad to have you
exercise him."
</p>

<p>
"How sweet of her!" Janet exclaimed.  "She
knows I love to drive.  I'll come this very
afternoon and take him out."
</p>

<p>
"We have our own horse, you know."  Alice
spoke with condescension, although Janet knew
quite well that only the rector ever drove the
ancient gray mare that kept Clinker company in
the rectory barn.
</p>

<p>
"I was tired of driving long ago," Mildred
upheld her sister.  "I wish father would buy an
automobile."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?" Janet asked.  "I don't believe I
could ever love an automobile."
</p>

<p>
Mildred looked at her in surprise and turned
to her sister.
</p>

<p>
"We must go, Alice," she said.  "Good-by,
Janet; don't forget to bring your sister to tea."
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't, and thank you ever so much."  Janet
watched her visitors until they reached the
shore road below the house.  She marveled at
the easy way in which they spoke of Phyllis and
called her "your sister" when she herself found
it so hard to grow accustomed to the relationship.
Finally she went back to her work.
</p>

<p>
The room that Phyllis and her aunt were to
have was long and low ceilinged.  It ran the
length of the front of the house.  Six latticed
windows opened to the south and looked over the
bay below.  It was a quaint room, hung in faded
chintz and furnished with heavy old mahogany.
Janet was doing her best to make it shine.
</p>

<p>
"I'll put some asters in a bowl on the table,"
she said to Boru, who was watching operations
from the doorway, "and then I think we will be
all ready.  Are you going to like your new
sister?" she asked laughingly, as she dropped to
her knee beside him and rubbed her cheek against
his shaggy coat.  "You must, you know, because
she's my twin, but you mustn't love her as much
as you do me."
</p>

<p>
Boru got up and walked away, as though he
considered that the only way to answer such a
silly remark.
</p>

<p>
Janet sat on the floor where he had left her
and cradled her chin in her hand and gave herself
up to sudden gloomy speculation.  Suppose
Phyllis turned out to be like Alice and Mildred!
The very idea chilled her, and she stared dismally
at the pretty room.
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose she'll have to like me just
because she's my sister," she said aloud; "perhaps
she'll think I'm different too, or maybe she'll
think I'm countrified.  Oh, dear, I almost wish
she were not coming."
</p>

<p>
Boru came back and snuggled into her lap, and
they sat quiet, both busy with their own thoughts
until Martha interrupted them.
</p>

<p>
"There you are, Miss Janet.  I knew you'd
be tiring yourself out with all this fixing.  Come
down to your lunch now; do, like a good child,
and let me do the rest."
</p>

<p>
Janet got up slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Martha, I don't feel a bit like eating,"
she said dolefully.
</p>

<p>
"And no wonder, working yourself to death,
poor lamb."  Martha's arms comforted her as
they had done many times before, and from the
shelter of one broad shoulder Janet confessed
her fears.
</p>

<p>
"Martha, what will I do if Phyllis doesn't like
me?"
</p>

<p>
Martha may be said to have snorted in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Not like you!" she ejaculated; "but, my
lamb, she's bound to; she's your own mother's
daughter and so, tell me now, how could she do
anything else?"  She offered this method of
reasoning as though it were sure to cast out any
doubts, and Janet gladly accepted it.
</p>

<p>
"What a baby I am," she laughed, wiping her
eyes; "look at Boru; he's disgusted with me, and
no wonder."
</p>

<p>
"Come now and have your lunch," Martha insisted;
"you'll see how hungry you are after the
first bite."
</p>

<p>
Janet was hungry, and her spirits brightened
with every mouthful.
</p>

<p>
"I wish it were to-morrow," she said, as she
lingered over her cantaloupe.  "I think I will die
of suspense if I don't find something to do.  I
thought I was going for a ride, but look, it's raining."
</p>

<p>
"And a good thing too," Martha replied
emphatically.  "I can't understand Mrs. Todd
letting you drive that horse of hers.  Some day it
will run away and kill you, and then I wonder
what she will say."
</p>

<p>
Janet laughed in spite of herself at so dismal
a picture, and got up from the table.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't die to-day, that's sure," she
said.  "I wish I could think of something really
interesting to do."
</p>

<p>
Martha thought for a minute, and then a smile
lit up her face.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I can find something that will
interest you," she said with some hesitation.
"Now that you know all about everything there
can't be any harm in it," she continued, lowering
her voice.
</p>

<p>
"In what?" Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
Martha beckoned to her mysteriously and led
the way upstairs all the way to the big attic.  It
was filled with old trunks and bits of broken
furniture and pictures, Janet had passed them many
times on her way to the "widow's walk" but she
had never been curious enough to give them a
second thought.
</p>

<p>
She watched Martha with interest as she pulled
out a little old trunk from one corner.  From a
bunch of keys that was hanging to one of the
rafters she selected the right one, and gave it to
Janet.
</p>

<p>
"There now, open that and see what you find,"
she said mysteriously.  "Now I must get back to
my work," she added briskly and bustled down
the stairs, leaving Janet looking at the key in
her hand.
</p>

<p>
Boru patted up the stairs and sniffed the trunk.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose we will find, old fellow?"
Janet asked him, as she fitted the key in the
lock.
</p>

<p>
At sight of the contents of the first tray she
gave a little exclamation of delight.  It was filled
with soft silks and laces, now yellow with age.
Janet lifted them out gently and discovered that
they were dresses.  Old-fashioned little things.
There was a pale yellow one and a robin's-egg
blue, made with hundreds of little tucks.
</p>

<p>
Janet smoothed them out with reverent fingers,
for she knew they had belonged to her mother.
</p>

<p>
The next tray held odds and ends, and Janet
sat down on the floor and lifted them out one by
one.  Packages of letters that almost fell to
pieces as she touched them, silk stockings of
every color, and three pairs of tiny slippers.  She
could hardly believe a foot was ever small enough
to fit them.
</p>

<p>
She found a wooden box too, beautifully carved
and filled with dozens of sheer handkerchiefs and,
best of all, a pile of books.  She read their titles
eagerly; "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austin,
Scott's "Lady of the Lake," Shakespeare's "As
You Like It" and a beautifully bound copy of
Mrs. Browning's poems.
</p>

<p>
"Then mother loved 'Little Ellie' too!" she
exclaimed.  There was something very wonderful
in the knowledge.
</p>

<p>
She put the books to one side and went on with
her discoveries.  Toward the very bottom she
found a chamois bag wrapped up in a yellow piece
of paper.  Inside of it was a jeweler's black-leather
case.  Janet's fingers trembled as she
opened it.
</p>

<p>
Lying on a bed of blue velvet was a miniature
set in a gold frame, and as she looked she gave
a cry of astonishment.  A face almost exactly
like her own smiled up at her.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," she whispered softly.
</p>

<p>
It was dusk before she left the attic, but when
she did go down stairs she went straight to Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know what was in that trunk?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
Martha nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I put them there myself," she said.  "Did
you have a happy afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
For answer, Janet threw her arms around her
and hugged her tight.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE DAY AT LAST
</h3>

<p>
"If it rains to-morrow I think I shall die,"
Janet said as she got ready for bed that
night.
</p>

<p>
She need have had no fears, for the next day
dawned clear, with just enough of autumn chill
in the air to whip the color into your cheeks.
Tom's telegram had said that they would arrive
by the same train that he had come by.
</p>

<p>
Janet wished it had been an earlier one, but
the day passed more quickly than she had hoped.
In the morning she drove Clinker out into the
woods and came back with the cart full of
brilliant autumn leaves.
</p>

<p>
As she drove back through the village it seemed
as though every one stopped her to ask when
Phyllis was coming.  She told them all, and her
excitement mounted every time she uttered the
magic words but toward afternoon the fear that
had depressed her the day before returned and
she could not shake it off.  She felt suddenly very
shy.  When train time came it was all she could
do not to fly to the Enchanted Kingdom and hide,
as she had done on the day of the fair.  She
walked up and down the platform in a fever of
excitement, and her hands were icy cold.
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Jenkins came out from the ticket office
to talk to her.
</p>

<p>
"Quite a day for you, isn't it?" he asked with
evident interest.  "Can't say as I ever heard of
another case quite like it.  To have a twin sister
that you never saw and didn't even know you had!
I often wondered when you'd find it out."
</p>

<p>
"Did you know all about it?" Janet asked in
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I should say I did."  Mr. Jenkins nodded his
head to give further weight to his words.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder why no one ever told me," Janet
said more to herself than to him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jenkins chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"I kinda guess all the folks that knew about
it, knew your grandmother didn't want it told,
and perhaps you've noticed folks have a way of
doing things like she wants."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that was it," Janet agreed idly.
"Isn't that the train?" she asked a minute later
as a faint rumble became audible.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jenkins consulted his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't wonder if it were," he said.  "I'd
better be getting the mail bags ready."
</p>

<p>
Janet couldn't very well ask him to wait, but
she watched his retreating figure with a sinking
feeling around her heart.  At least he was
somebody to talk to, and anything was better than
being alone.  She could feel her heart pounding,
and something in her throat seemed to interfere
with her breathing.
</p>

<p>
Never did a train take so long to slow up and
finally stop, but Janet found herself suddenly
wishing that it would take twice as long.
</p>

<p>
The first person to alight was Tom, and he took
time to wave to her before he turned to help down
a slender little lady dressed in pearl gray.  Janet
started forward to meet them, and then stopped
short for she saw herself stepping off the train;
eyes, hair, straight little nose, even to the
solitary dimple in the left cheek.  She was carrying
a basket and she was laughing at Tom.  Then
she looked up and stopped too.
</p>

<p>
The Page twins stared at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Janet!"  Phyllis was the first to regain the
power of speech.  She dropped her basket into
Tom's arms and ran forward.
</p>

<p>
The next thing Janet knew she was being kissed
and hugged.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you adorable love!" Phyllis exclaimed
rapturously.  "Isn't it all perfectly thrilling and
fairy-taleish?  I could just eat you alive, I am so
excited.  Please say right away that you are going
to love me or I shall die of misery."
</p>

<p>
Poor Janet!  She had never heard so many
adjectives in all her life and the speed with which
Phyllis rattled on dumbfounded her.  Miss
Carter, Aunt Mog, came to her rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis, my love, do stop talking and give
some one else a chance to say how do you do to
Janet."  She laughed.  "Janet, my dear, I am
your Aunt Mog, and I am, oh, so very happy to
see you."
</p>

<p>
Janet kissed her and murmured, "Thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't I get a kiss, little sister of mine?"
Tom inquired in his deep, good-natured voice.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of it Janet found her tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do!" she exclaimed.  "Oh, I
am so happy, I can't think of anything to say,"
she confessed shyly.
</p>

<p>
"You precious love, that's just exactly the way
I feel!"  Phyllis could not keep still another
instant.  "There are all sorts of funny little chills
miming up and down my back and&mdash;oh, for goodness'
sakes, Tommy, what are you doing to Sir
Galahad!" She snatched the basket away from
Tom and lifted out a huge tortoise-shell cat with
a big blue bow around his neck.
</p>

<p>
Boru, who had been sniffing at Tom's side, gave
a sudden jump, and Janet caught him just in time
to save the cat.
</p>

<p>
"Get down, sir," she scolded, "and don't you
dare to touch that cat.  Do you understand?"  Boru
slunk away with his tail between his legs.
</p>

<p>
"Poor kitty, did he frighten you?  I'm so
sorry,"&mdash;Janet stroked the ruffled fur
comfortingly.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis laughed.  "What a time we will have
with those two!" she exclaimed; "but they'll
make friends sooner or later.  Sir Galahad is
just as much to blame as your dog.  He has no
manners when it comes to dogs.  Go back in your
basket, you're in disgrace."
</p>

<p>
"Let's make at least a start for home," Tom
suggested.  "I'm hungry."
</p>

<p>
"There's a wagon to carry up your bags,"
Janet said, "but I'm afraid we will have to
walk."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, let's do start.  I'm simply crazy to
see the house and grandmother and Martha.
Here, Tommy, you carry puss, now that you have
no bags.  I'm going to walk with Janet.  You
and Auntie Mogs can bring up the rear."
</p>

<p>
"You are going to do no such thing," her aunt
contradicted her smilingly.  "I don't want Janet
deaf by the time we reach the house, and besides
I want to talk to her myself."
</p>

<p>
She took Janet's arm and started off, and
Phyllis and Tom followed.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis doesn't always talk as much as this,"
she said as they walked along; "she is just
excited to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I love it," Janet said quickly.
"She's&mdash;well she's everything she said I was."  She
looked at her companion and smiled.  Miss Carter
was a dainty little lady, Janet thought she
looked as though she had just stepped down from
a Dresden vase, her cheeks were such a soft shell
pink and her eyes such a delicate china blue.
Unconsciously she looked down at her feet; they
were nearly small enough to fit the slippers in
the trunk in the attic.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Janet, do tell me who lives in that cunning
little house!" Phyllis called.
</p>

<p>
"The Waters," Janet told her; "that's Harry
looking out of the barn door."
</p>

<p>
Phyllis laughed merrily.  "Oh, but he's fat,"
she cried.  "Do you know him!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Like him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much."
</p>

<p>
"Why!"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't he the boy who is afraid of snakes?"
Tom asked, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't blame him for that!" Phyllis
exclaimed.  "I'm scared to death of the crawly
things myself, but I do think he is a little bit
too fat."  She chattered on and succeeded in
monopolizing the conversation until they reached
the house.  At the first glimpse of it she went
into ecstasies.
</p>

<p>
"It's perfect," she announced from the garden
gate.  "Oh, Janet, do love me so that I can stay
here always.  There's a real sundial!  Auntie
Mogs, do look.  Tommy, you never told me about
it.  And what ducky little white flowers!"
</p>

<p>
In the hall she was equally enthusiastic over
the grandfather's clock and the big brass
warming pan.
</p>

<p>
Martha met them at the door, arrayed in a stiff
white apron, her face shiny with soap applied
vigorously.
</p>

<p>
Before she had a chance to speak, Phyllis was
shaking her hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're Martha," she said.  "I'm awfully
glad to know you."
</p>

<p>
Martha turned to Miss Carter.  "She said that
like Master Tom," she said.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Mog smiled.  "Yes, she is very like her
father," she said.  "I see it so often.  It's queer,
isn't it!  Janet is more like her mother."
</p>

<p>
"She is, indeed, ma'm, even in her ways."  Martha
spoke proudly, and she looked at Janet
affectionately.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you be coming up to your room?  You
must be tired."
</p>

<p>
They all followed her upstairs, Phyllis leading
the way and once more carrying her cat.
</p>

<p>
Tom brought up the rear, carrying the bags,
which had arrived a few minutes before from the
station.
</p>

<p>
"I must change my dress before I see grandmother,"
Phyllis said as she opened a big suitcase,
"but I won't be a minute, so stay and talk
to me while I wash in this adorable basin," she
said to Janet.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Mog took off her hat and with a smile,
which neither of the girls noticed, she slipped
from the room and joined Tom at the foot of
the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite perfect, as Phyllis says," she
laughed, "and now suppose I go in and say 'how
do you do' to Mrs. Page."
</p>

<p>
When the girls came down a few minutes later
they heard voices and Tom's hearty laugh.  Janet
sighed with relief and opened the door softly.
</p>

<p>
"Grandmother," she said in the hushed voice
she always used in that room, "here is Phyllis."
</p>

<p>
Before Mrs. Page had had time really to look
at her other granddaughter, Phyllis had kissed
her warmly on both cheeks and was rattling on in
her joyful way.
</p>

<p>
"Grandmother, isn't this fun!" she demanded.
"I'm so glad to see you.  Why, only just imagine,
I never knew you existed until Tom came out of
the skies and told me about you and Janet.  You
can imagine, can't you, how surprised I was, and
of course I've been simply crazy to see you ever
since."
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis dearest, be careful; I'm afraid you'll
tire your grandmother with so much chattering,"
Aunt Mog admonished gently.
</p>

<p>
"Let the child alone, Marjorie," Mrs. Page
snapped.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I'm sorry," Phyllis was contrite at
once, "I always forget, and you know you don't
look a bit sick, grandmother, even though you are
in bed.  Here, let me shake up your pillows for
you.  They don't look half puffy enough to be
really comfortable."  She suited the action to
the word, and in the twinkling of an eye the
pillows were re-arranged to her satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Keep still a minute, child," Mrs. Page said
not unkindly; "I want to look at you."
</p>

<p>
Phyllis smiled down at her, and stood as still as
it was possible for her.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would all leave me now," Mrs. Page
said when she had studied each of
Phyllis's features in turn.  "Come in and say
good night to me, child, when Janet comes."
</p>

<p>
They left her, and the girls went into the
garden.  Janet was too surprised to voice her
thoughts, but Phyllis did not seem even to know
that she had done anything out of the ordinary.
She dismissed her grandmother with "she's really
a love," and returned to more important subjects.
</p>

<p>
By evening she knew all about the Enchanted
Kingdom, Peter, Mrs. Todd and the Blake girls,
and she had moved her suitcase into Janet's room,
"for&mdash;" she said&mdash;"what is the use of having a
sister if you can't sleep with her and talk over
things with her in the dark."
</p>

<p>
Miss Carter and Tom, sitting in the living-room
before the fire, heard the buzz of their voices
late into the night.
</p>

<p>
"How alike they are," she said, smiling.  "And
yet how absolutely different."
</p>

<p>
Tom nodded.  "And to think they're both my
sisters; bless 'em, do you know, Auntie Mogs,
I'm a very proud man this night!"
</p>

<p>
Auntie Mogs leaned over and patted his hand
in understanding.
</p>

<p>
"They must never be separated again," she
said with decision.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
A DAY TOGETHER
</h3>

<p>
Janet kept her eyes tight closed the next
morning, long after she was awake.  She
was afraid to open them lest the memories
that had crowded into her consciousness should
prove to be only dreams.  Phyllis was dancing
inside of her eyelids, and she smiled at her and
closed her eyes tighter to keep her there.
</p>

<p>
After a long while she turned over very quietly
and listened.  Some one was breathing softly on
the other side of the big bed.  She opened her
eyes very slowly and found herself looking
straight into Phyllis's merry ones.
</p>

<p>
They both laughed.  Janet from relief, Phyllis
from sheer joy.
</p>

<p>
"I've been watching you for perfect hours.  I
thought you were never going to wake up.  I very
nearly pinched you," Phyllis exclaimed.  "Isn't
it time to get up!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's late, and, thank goodness, it's a
beautiful day," Janet replied.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis bounded out of bed and pulled all the
covers off of Janet.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, you sleepy head, and I'll race you
getting dressed!" she challenged.
</p>

<p>
Janet was up in a second and clothes flew in
every direction.  Martha had left a big can of
hot water in the hall outside their door, and
Phyllis was giggling so hard when she tried to
pour it into the basin that she splashed some of
it on her bare toes.
</p>

<p>
"Cricky, but that hurts!" she cried, sitting
down on the side of the bed to nurse it.  Sir
Galahad got up from his basket by the window to
come over and see what all the noise was about,
and at the same time Boru pushed open the door
with his black muzzle.
</p>

<p>
For an instant the two animals looked at each
other, then Boru growled and Sir Galahad arched
his back and hissed.  Janet and Phyllis just
caught them in time to avoid a scrap.
</p>

<p>
Sir Galahad went back in his basket, and the
lid was closed and Boru was shut out into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"What under the sun are we going to do with
those two!" Phyllis demanded.
</p>

<p>
"They will just have to get used to each other,
but I'm afraid it won't be easy," Janet replied.
"Boru hates cats."
</p>

<p>
They finished their dressing and consulted Tom
at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what to do," he suggested.  "You
both go off somewhere this morning and leave the
live stock with me, when you come back they will
both be eating out of the same dish."
</p>

<p>
Janet and Phyllis exchanged glances and shook
their heads doubtfully, but they decided to let
him try, after they had made him solemnly promise
not to let any harm come to either of them.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall we go!" Phyllis demanded.
"Shall we take a walk!"
</p>

<p>
"We might take a drive," Janet suggested.
"Mrs. Todd sent me word that I could have
Clinker whenever I wanted him."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, that's the very thing!" Phyllis
enthused.  "He is at the rectory, isn't he!  Let's
go this very instant.  I'm crazy to see those Blake
girls."
</p>

<p>
Janet had an unhappy moment of doubt.  Suppose
Phyllis liked the Blakes, what would she do
then?  But she led the way to the village.  She
only showed that she was worried by being a little
quieter than usual.  As Phyllis talked all the way,
her silence was not noticeable.
</p>

<p>
Alice and Mildred must have seen them coming
down Main Street, for they were at the gate to
meet them.  Janet introduced them and waited.
She expected Phyllis to enthuse as she had been
doing ever since her arrival, but a surprise
awaited her.
</p>

<p>
From the laughing, bright-eyed youngster
Phyllis changed all in the twinkling of an eye into
a quiet self-possessed girl.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?  I'm very glad to meet you."  She
shook hands with Alice and nodded carelessly
to Mildred.
</p>

<p>
"We are going for a drive," she went on, still
walking toward the barn.  "That is, Janet is
going to do the driving, and I am going to watch
her in real envy."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know how to drive?" Alice inquired.
"Mildred and I really don't care for it,
we've done so much of it."
</p>

<p>
Janet watched Phyllis and waited, wondering
what she would say to such a silly snubbing.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis looked at both the girls before her and
a roguish grin tilted up the corners of her mouth,
and then she laughed.  It was a merry little laugh,
but it made Alice feel very small and very
uncomfortable so that she would have given almost
anything not to have made her last silly remark.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you coming in!" Mildred asked hastily.
"We'd love to have you."
</p>

<p>
"Not just now, thanks; we are going for a drive,
you see."  Phyllis smiled and followed Janet into
the barn, where the hired man was already
harnessing Clinker.  Alice and Mildred stayed and
talked until they were ready to go.
</p>

<p>
"You'll stop in on your way back, won't you?"
Alice almost begged.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks, we will if we have time," Phyllis
replied sweetly.
</p>

<p>
Once on the main road and bowling along
briskly, she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you don't like them!" she
exclaimed.  "Of all the sillies!  Why, Janet, they
are what old-fashioned books call stuck up."  She
laughed until the tears rolled down her
cheeks.  "I wish we could have them at school
for about a month; they would learn so many
things, and how I'd love to help teach them."
</p>

<p>
"If you think they're funny, what must you
think of me?" Janet spoke, without thinking and
regretted it at once.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis eyed her reproachfully.  "I don't think
that's a very nice thing to say to your sister,"
she said slowly.  "How could I think you anything
but the most wonderful girl in the world
when I've been longing for you all these years."
</p>

<p>
"Longing for me?" Janet queried in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, longing for you!" Phyllis returned with
spirit, "and that's more than you can say about me."
</p>

<p>
"It's no such thing," Janet denied hotly.  "I
have wanted a sister always.  Why, I wrote Tom
and told him I wished he'd been a girl instead of a boy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you darling, did you really?"  Phyllis
returned to her gay self in a flash.  "Isn't it just
like a story?  I wanting you, oh, so much, and you
wanting me, and now here we are.  I don't see
what in the world we are fussing about, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Then let's stop," Janet said wisely.  "Shall
I drive you to Mrs. Todd's house?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do; I want to see the big room you were
telling me about.  Auntie Mogs has a lovely
library, so you won't miss your Kingdom so very
much when you come to town."
</p>

<p>
"Come to town?" Janet inquired.  "But I'm
not going to town, am I?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are," Phyllis insisted.  "I
heard Tommy and Auntie Mogs talking about it
on the train and again this morning.  Gracious,
you don't suppose that now I've found you I'm
going to ever let you out of my sight, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"But how can I go to town?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, why in the world can't you?"
</p>

<p>
"But grandmother?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't worry about that.  Tommy will take
care of it.  Anyway you're coming, and we are
going to school together; and, oh, Janet,"&mdash;Phyllis
broke off impatiently&mdash;"aren't you the
least little bit excited about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Excited!  I could scream from excitement
only I'm breathless, and my mind is all upside
down," Janet replied, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, thank goodness!"&mdash;Phyllis was comforted.
"I was afraid you really didn't want to
come, and I was just having fits, for of course I
told all the girls about you, and they are nearly
as excited as I am.  Where have you been going
to school?  I asked Tommy, but he didn't know."
</p>

<p>
"I've never been to school, real school, in my
life," Janet confessed.  "Grandmother has
always had a tutor come every day from Swanet&mdash;that's
the next town to us.  I don't suppose I
know very much and I'll probably be years behind
you, but perhaps I can catch up."
</p>

<p>
"Years behind!  Nonsense, I haven't any
brains," Phyllis said, "and I don't really care
very much.  The girls at school that are really
brainy are awfully stupid; that is&mdash;oh, you know
what I mean."
</p>

<p>
They were passing the Simpsons' house by now,
and Janet saw a familiar figure standing in the
roadway.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you suppose Harry Waters is
doing so far from home?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis looked and laughed.  "Oh, that's the
fat boy we saw last night, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I never knew him to walk as far as
this before,"&mdash;Janet was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Let's give him a lift back," Phyllis suggested.
</p>

<p>
Janet called, and Harry waved in reply, but he
did not come out to them.
</p>

<p>
"He's bashful," Janet laughed.  "I'll chase
him."  She turned Clinker in at the gate, and
although Harry did his best to retreat to the barn,
they were soon beside him.
</p>

<p>
"This is my sister Phyllis," Janet said.
"Don't you want to drive back with us?"
</p>

<p>
Harry hung his head and mumbled something
about walking.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing over here anyway?"
Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," Harry replied sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Good."  Phyllis spoke for the first time.
"Then there is no reason why you can't ride home
with us; we were going on a little farther but we
can do that another day, can't we, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
It was a new idea to Janet to put off going to
the Enchanted Kingdom for the sake of Harry's
company, but she nodded and let down the flap of
the cart and Harry jumped in without another
word.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis turned her back to the horse and talked
to him, though it must be admitted it was a
one-sided conversation, for Harry refused to say more
than "yes" or "no" in answer to her numerous
questions.
</p>

<p>
Janet, who knew him better than he knew himself,
realized that he was angry, but she was too
much occupied with her driving to give any
assistance to Phyllis.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the edge of the village
Harry insisted upon jumping down, and before
they realized it he was lost to view in the scrub
oak by the side of the road.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis turned around with an ejaculation of
amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever see such an extraordinary boy?
What do you suppose is the matter with him?"
</p>

<p>
Janet laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine; it isn't like Harry to be
mysterious," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd have to laugh the way he sat
there and glowered at me."  Phyllis was frankly
surprised that any one could withstand her
charms.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she added with a sigh, "I suppose,
now that we have spoiled our chances of going to
your Enchanted Kingdom we may as well stop
in to say how do you do to the Blakes."
</p>

<p>
Janet was not enthusiastic over the proposal,
but she agreed, with a nod, and after Clinker was
safely in the barn they went around to the front
porch and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
Alice came to the door.  She was delighted to
see them, and it was evident she had not expected
them to return so soon.  She ushered them into
the living-room where a cheery fire was blazing
in the fireplace.  Mrs. Blake and Mildred were
sewing before it, and Mrs. Blake greeted the girls
with her usual sweet manner.
</p>

<p>
They stayed until lunch time, and when they
left they had given their promise to return the
next day at four o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"We are not going to have a party," Mrs. Blake
assured them, "but we want to ask some of
the ladies in to meet you and your aunt," she
spoke to Phyllis.
</p>

<p>
"Are all the girls in Old Chester like the
Blakes?" Phyllis inquired, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Janet made a little face.
</p>

<p>
"They are," she replied dismally.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis put her arm around her and hugged
her tight.
</p>

<p>
"You poor darling," she said; "no wonder you
wanted a sister.  Well, you've got one, and we'll
have a good time at their party.  You see if we
won't."
</p>

<p>
When they reached home a comical tableau
greeted them.  Tom was sitting on the stone
bench in the garden holding a plate of milk
between his knees.  From one side Sir Galahad
lapped daintily and from the other, one ear cocked
suspiciously, Boru's pink tongue was greedily
bespattering his black muzzle.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
AT THE RECTORY FOR TEA
</h3>

<p>
The dining-room table at the rectory was
laden with sandwiches and baskets of
cake.  Mrs. Blake sat at one end pouring
tea, and Mildred and Alice took turns with the
chocolate pot at the other.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Blake had not been entirely truthful when
she had said that she was not going to give a real
party, for the people who walked in and out of
the two rooms gave an air of festivity that was
rivaled only by fairs and weddings in Old Chester.
</p>

<p>
Miss Carter dressed in the palest of gray
satin gowns was busy renewing her many
acquaintances, and Janet and Phyllis were the
center of a laughing group of girls and boys.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis had on a dainty afternoon dress of dark
blue chiffon, which contrasted oddly with the more
elaborately made summer dresses on the other
girls.
</p>

<p>
Janet wore her customary white piqué dress
with its broad belt of black patent leather.
Mrs. Page believed in simplicity, and as far back as
Janet could remember she had always owned just
such a dress.  It served to wear to church and
to the occasional meetings of the Ladies' Aid
Society that met in her grandmother's room.
</p>

<p>
She was conscious this afternoon that its plainness
marked her among the other girls, and she
looked at Phyllis with just a touch of envy in her
soft brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
Aunty Mog from far across the room saw the
look, and made a mental note of it.
</p>

<p>
There was a very small percentage of boys in
comparison with the girls, but among these Harry
Waters stood out.  His hair was brushed back
sleek against his bullet-shaped head, and the
dotted Windsor tie, that his mother had insisted
on his wearing, accentuated his fatness.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis greeted him upon his arrival like an old
friend and insisted on his talking to her, although
it was very apparent that Harry was miserably
embarrassed.  Janet, who was busy at that
moment talking dogs to the old country doctor,
watched them, and wondered that Harry still
carried with him his air of mystery.  She
determined to find out what was the matter with him
before the end of the afternoon.  She had not
long to wait, before Harry gave her a clew.
</p>

<p>
He refused refreshments!
</p>

<p>
"But, Harry, surely you're going to have
something," Mildred insisted.  She spoke more loudly
than she had intended, and all eyes turned toward
her.
</p>

<p>
Poor Harry turned very red and stammered.
</p>

<p>
"But honestly, Mildred, I don't want it," he
protested, almost in tears.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what is the matter with Harry,"
Mrs. Waters confided to the women around her;
"he won't eat a thing, and he's so quiet."
</p>

<p>
"But surely you'll have a piece of chocolate
cake," Alice said and she held a plate temptingly
before him.  But Harry was obdurate.  He shook
his head, speech had left him minutes before, and
looked about him for a means of escape.
</p>

<p>
Janet beckoned to him, and when they saw their
chance they slipped into the pantry and took
refuge on the back stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Now," Janet said sharply, "tell me what the
matter is?  I know you're not sick."
</p>

<p>
"Gee, of course I'm not.  Can't a fellow
refuse food without all this fuss?" Harry
complained bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Some could but not you; come on, tell me
what's wrong.  If you don't, I'll guess anyway,"
Janet threatened.
</p>

<p>
Harry eyed her dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will," he agreed.  "Well, it's
this then&mdash;I heard what your sister said last night
when you were coming back from the station
about&mdash;about&mdash;well, about me."
</p>

<p>
Janet thought for a minute and then she
laughed.  It was not an unkind laugh however,
and Harry reluctantly joined in.
</p>

<p>
"Is that why you refused refreshments?" she
demanded, and Harry nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And that's what I was doing out at Simpsons
too," he added.  "I was walking to reduce.  I
didn't want to ride home, but, gee, she wouldn't
let me off&mdash;" he stopped abruptly, for some one
was pushing open the door.  It was Phyllis.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are, you scamps!" she whispered.
"I've been looking everywhere for you.  Changed
your mind about that cake, Harry?  I brought
you a piece in case you had."
</p>

<p>
Harry looked miserably from the cake in her
hand to her laughing eyes, and once more shook
his head in refusal.
</p>

<p>
"All right then, I'll eat it."  Phyllis broke the
large piece in half and handed one piece to Janet.
"Here, Jan, you have to help me, and now listen
both of you.  I've thought of the greatest idea
that ever was."
</p>

<p>
She sat down between them on the step, and
like Janet, rested her chin in her hand.  They
looked so much alike that Harry could not help
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"What's your idea?" Janet inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Harry, can you keep a secret?" Phyllis demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I can.  I'm not a girl," Harry answered
defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Now what do you mean by that?"  Phyllis sat
up very straight, her eyes bright with a challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know girls can't keep secrets," he
said crossly.
</p>

<p>
"Very well,"&mdash;Phyllis dismissed the subject
airily and sat munching her cake with evident
relish.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going to tell us?" Harry asked
sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"No, not you,"&mdash;Phyllis smiled at him sweetly
and winked roguishly at Janet.
</p>

<p>
Harry got up and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"All right, don't then," he said angrily.
"You're just exactly as bad as Janet," he added,
and the door shut behind him with a bang.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis put her head on Janet's shoulder and
laughed until she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Harry; that's the very worst thing he
could think of to say to you."  Janet laughed
almost as hard as her sister.  "I bet he is
eating everything in sight this minute.  He heard
you say he was fat and&mdash;well, now you can
understand why he wouldn't eat."
</p>

<p>
Phyllis was serious in a second.
</p>

<p>
"Was that really the reason!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I shouldn't have told you."  Janet
was ashamed of having betrayed a confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you did," Phyllis said slowly, "and
I'm sorry I teased him, but really he shouldn't
talk about girls that way, and my idea will really
be lots more fun if no one knows it except
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" Janet inquired eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis lowered her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Grandmother told Auntie Mogs to ask any of
these people to come to our house to tea any
afternoon she liked," she began; "to sort of return
this, you know.  So she has asked them for
Thursday.  Now I haven't talked to a single girl
to-day that didn't say how different we were and
they made me furious until suddenly&mdash;" she
lowered her voice and the rest of the sentence was
lost in the soft waves of Janet's hair.  It must
have been amusing, for Janet's eyes sparkled with
suppressed merriment.
</p>

<p>
When they joined the others a few minutes later
they both looked very demure, so much so in fact
that Auntie Mogs, who knew Phyllis thoroughly,
knew that they were planning some mischief.
</p>

<p>
Miss Clark had arrived during their absence
and was apparently amazed beyond speech at the
striking resemblance between them.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen many twins in my time!" she
exclaimed, "but I never saw anything so
remarkable!  Why, you could never in the world tell
them apart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I think you could easily.  They're not a
bit alike," Alice said, from the chocolate pot.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis looked at Janet, and a swift glance of
understanding and amusement passed between
them.
</p>

<p>
"And, oh, Janet,"&mdash;Miss Clark was speaking
again&mdash;"I almost forgot to tell you that there
is a letter in your box for you.  Seems to me you
are getting lots of mail lately.  I didn't recognize
the handwriting."
</p>

<p>
Again Phyllis and Janet exchanged glances,
and this time their looks said as plainly as words
"Peter."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
A FULL CUP OF HAPPINESS
</h3>

<p>
The letter was from Peter, as Janet had
hoped.  She opened it eagerly and read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear Janet:</i>
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd says that I really ought to send
you a telegram, but a letter can say so much more,
and I have a whole lot to say.
</p>

<p>
"First of all, I came to Boston intending to
get something to do as a first step toward the
West, but would you believe it whom should I
run into the day after I landed but Doc.  He
grabbed me by the arm, and I felt the way I did
the day Mr. Simpson appeared in the doorway
of the 'E.K.'  He hardly spoke to me, but hustled
me off to his house, and there I found the
explanation of his queer behavior.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd was sitting in the office waiting
for me!  My ears still tingle when I remember
what she said!  But I guess I deserved it.  And
now comes the amazing part of my story.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to school.  She and Doc, who are
old friends, by the way, insist upon it.  Then,
next spring, one of my 'E.K.' schemes is coming
true.  Mrs. Todd is going to let me raise sheep
on her place.  This is all thanks to you, Princess,
and some day I'm going to show you that I am
really grateful.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Todd wants me to tell you that she will
be back within a few days, and she hopes it will
be in time for your surprise.  What is your
surprise?
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Yours in the bonds of the E.K.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PETER GIBBS."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Janet read the letter aloud to Phyllis and explained
the parts of it that she did not understand.
</p>

<p>
"I knew Mrs. Todd would do something like
that," Janet exclaimed, delightedly.
</p>

<p>
"She must be a dear," Phyllis said.  "I'm
crazy to meet her."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Janet that with this last good
news her cup of happiness was full to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
The next few days passed all too hurriedly.
They spent them out of doors for the most part,
either driving or paddling on the bay.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis added admiration to her affection for
Janet.  It seemed to her that she could do almost
everything in the outdoor line and do it well.  As
a city girl she marveled and predicted a great
success in athletics at school.
</p>

<p>
The day before the tea was so warm and sunshiny
that they decided to have a picnic out in
the woods.  Martha packed them a basket filled
with twice as much as they needed, and they made
an early start.
</p>

<p>
They walked out into the country beyond the
village, and Tom chose a sheltered corner under
the lee of a hill, and built a fire.  Janet helped him,
and together they roasted potatoes and broiled
a steak.  Auntie Mogs and Phyllis watched and
offered suggestions.  Phyllis upset a jar of
Martha's specially preserved peaches, but only Tom
saw her, and she scooped them back into the glass,
only adding a pine needle or two.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy, don't you dare to tell," she whispered,
and Tom, who had dropped the steak only
the minute before had to promise.
</p>

<p>
It was a merry little party, and Tom kept them
all laughing with tales about picnics and camping
trips out in the West.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy, I think, now that you have found two
new and perfectly nice sisters, that the least you
could do would be to invite them out to pay you
a visit," Phyllis suggested airily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you do, eh?" Tom asked lazily.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do; don't you, Janet?"&mdash;Phyllis
turned for support.
</p>

<p>
"I do," Janet answered solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Children, you have no manners," Auntie
Mogs chided.  "If I were Tom, I should never
think of asking you now."
</p>

<p>
"Just as I feel about it,"&mdash;Tom tried to make
his voice sound very dignified and cold and failed
utterly.  "I intended asking you all next summer,
but of course now I shall limit my invitation to
just you, Aunt Mog, and I do hope you will accept."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I will," Auntie Mogs answered laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Meanie," Phyllis teased.  "If you ever did
such a thing!  But seriously, Tommy, did you
mean to ask us next summer?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll accept with thanks; won't we, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; can't we leave the day after school
closes?" Janet suggested.  "There's no use in
wasting time."
</p>

<p>
"Or even before,"&mdash;Phyllis was not to be outdone.
</p>

<p>
"Here, here," Tom protested, "not quite so
fast.  I accept your acceptance of my ungiven
invitation, but I insist on naming the day.
</p>

<p>
"I stump you both to climb that tree over
there," he added, pointing to a tall pine; "the
one who wins can have the last piece of cake."
</p>

<p>
Both girls started for the tree.  Janet was
almost to the top before Phyllis was half way up.
As she climbed down again she noticed that
Phyllis was very white and standing perfectly
still, holding tightly to the trunk.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter!" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis looked at her beseechingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Janet, I'm scared to death," she
whispered.  "I looked down and now I am terribly
dizzy; what shall I do!"
</p>

<p>
Janet came close and took hold of her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your eyes on the sky," she directed.
"Don't look down for even a second and don't be
afraid.  I'm here and I won't let you fall."
</p>

<p>
She dropped quickly to the branch below and
took one of Phyllis's ankles in her strong grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Hold tight to the bough above and let your foot
swing free, I'll put it on a safe branch.  There
now, bring the other one down beside it."  In this
way she helped her carefully and surely to the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," Phyllis was almost in tears, "thank you,
darling.  I am quite sure you saved my life.  Oh,
dear, I'm still dizzy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, stand still a minute until you are better.
There's no need for Tommy to know.  He'd be
sure to tease," Janet whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care about Tom, but I hate being such a
baby.  You went way to the top," Phyllis answered.
</p>

<p>
"You tried, anyway," Janet consoled her, "and
that's what counts."
</p>

<p>
"You're a darling to say so, anyway," Phyllis
said gratefully.  "I feel better now; let's go back."
</p>

<p>
Tom held the cake out to Janet.
</p>

<p>
"It's yours, you won by a dozen branches.
What happened, Phyllis?  Did you get scared?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," Janet answered for her.  "I
promised to go halves, so what was the need of
her climbing too,"&mdash;she held out a piece of the
cake, and Phyllis took it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, that's not fair," Tom protested.
"You should eat every bit of it yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No, we're twins and we have to share everything,"
Janet insisted.  "Isn't that so, Phyllis?"
</p>

<p>
Phyllis nodded seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," she said, and it sounded like a
prophecy.
</p>

<p>
On the way home Mrs. Todd called them as they
passed the rectory.  She had only just returned,
and she was so delighted at Janet's good fortune
that she kissed her, much to every one's surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Please tell me about Peter," Janet whispered,
when she had the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Peter is a rogue," Mrs. Todd answered, "but
I can't help loving him, and he has promised to be
my right hand for the rest of my days.  I had a
hard time making Dr. Peabody agree to my
schemes, but I am a very determined woman, once
my mind is made up, and so he had to give in
finally."
</p>

<p>
"What have you made your mind up to this
time, Ann?" Miss Carter inquired, from the other
side of the room.
</p>

<p>
"A red-headed boy," Mrs. Todd laughed.  "I
have seen enough of all my friends with children
to think about and I've made up my mind to have
one too.  I wanted Janet, but I knew you'd find
her some day, Marjorie, and so I found Peter.
He's alone and so am I.  I think we are going to
have a very good time together&mdash;raising sheep,"
she added with a twinkle in her eye.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it wonderful about Peter?" Janet asked
as she walked home beside her aunt.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed it is, my dear," Auntie Mogs agreed.
"Ann is a darling under her bruskness, and she
is very fond of you, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I love her too," Janet replied; "she
has been so good to me."
</p>

<p>
Miss Carter put her arm through hers and
looked down at her with serious eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It would be difficult to imagine any one being
anything else.  Dear little girl," she added
tenderly, "you are very like your beautiful mother.
Do you think you could be happy with Phyllis
and me?  We want you very much indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Auntie Mogs," Janet said in a queer little
voice, "I want you too."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
TWINS INDEED
</h3>

<p>
Janet and Phyllis stood in the middle of
Janet's room and looked at each other.
There was nothing apparently that was
strange in their appearance.  One had on a dark
blue, chiffon, afternoon dress and the other a
white piqué with a black belt.
</p>

<p>
They joined hands and stood before the mirror,
and then they both began to laugh very hard.
Boru, who had been dozing on the floor in a patch
of sunlight, got up and came over to them.  A
keen observer might have thought it odd that he
chose the blue chiffon dress to rub up against
instead of the white one.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
A keen observer might have thought it odd that he chose <br>
the blue chiffon dress to rub against instead of the <br>
white one.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis noticed it and laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Funny how fond Boru is of me, isn't it?" she
asked.  Then they went down stairs together.
</p>

<p>
Auntie Mogs was busy arranging some flowers
in a bowl.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis, help me with these, will you, dear!"
</p>

<p>
The white dress stepped forward and then stood
still, and the blue chiffon was soon bending over
the table.
</p>

<p>
Martha came into the room, carrying a plate
of tea biscuits.
</p>

<p>
"Put these on the side table, Miss Janet,
please," she said, and the white dress did as she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with you children!"
Auntie Mogs asked.  "You are so quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all," they both answered together.
</p>

<p>
Tom came in and looked around hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody here yet!  Then I'm going to have
a cooky, a piece of cake and some candy.  Janet,
dear little sister of mine, give me one of those
biscuits, or two if you insist."  The white dress
offered him the plate and two brown eyes looked
at him hard as he helped himself.  But he filled
his pockets unconcernedly and turned toward the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis, other little sister of mine, have you
a flower for my button hole!  I'm not going to
be at your party, but I want to look festive none
the less."
</p>

<p>
The blue dress stood very close to him as the
flower was carefully poked into place.
</p>

<p>
"You are both very quiet this afternoon, it
seems to me," he observed critically, looking from
one to the other.  "What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
The girls began to laugh, and they kept it up
until they had to lean on each other for support.
</p>

<p>
"Well, evidently something is very wrong indeed,
but I didn't mean to remind you of it.  Are
you going to do this often during the afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Only suppressed gurgles answered him, and he
marched off to his own room in disgust.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before the guests began to arrive.
</p>

<p>
Miss Carter met them at the door, and the
girls both shook hands with each one and then
went off for tea or cake, and each time the guest
said, "Thank you, Janet," to the white dress,
and "That's very sweet of you," to the blue one.
And every now and then both girls would
disappear into the hall, laugh silently and return
to their posts.
</p>

<p>
The Blakes were among the first arrivals, and
Mrs. Todd was with them.  Mildred and Alice
were a little surprised that the wearer of the
white dress came up to them and said "hello!"
in the friendliest way.
</p>

<p>
"Will you have a cup of tea and a biscuit?
You ought to be hungry after that long walk, or
did you drive over?  Oh, but of course you didn't;
I forgot you were tired of driving."  The white
dress fluttered away to return a minute later with
tea.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are; can you manage all the plates?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," Mildred replied.  "How
nice it must be for you to have your sister here,"
she said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is rather nice."
</p>

<p>
"Rather nice!" Alice exclaimed.  "I should
think it would be a perfect blessing."
</p>

<p>
"Now, why a blessing?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why because it is some one for you to
be with."  Alice was amazed.  "You must have
been awfully lonely before she came?"
</p>

<p>
"Lonely&mdash;I?  How silly!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, but you never went with any of the girls
except us now and again, and naturally every one
thought you must be lonely.  Alice isn't the only
one who thought so," Mildred said vehemently.
</p>

<p>
"Then every one was wrong.  I never was
lonely for a minute.  I had too many things to
think about.  Of course it is nice having a sister
that understands you, but even without her I
would not be lonely."  The white dress drifted
away at a sign from the hostess, and Alice and
Mildred were left looking at each other in pained
surprise.  They were wearing their hair rolled
up and tied at the back of their necks for the first
time, and they couldn't imagine why Janet had
said nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
"How queer she is to-day," Mildred said.
</p>

<p>
"And to think we always thought of her as
lonely!  I guess she didn't come to see us any
oftener because she didn't want to," Alice replied.
</p>

<p>
Across the room, Miss Clark was talking to the
wearer of the blue dress.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it beautiful to think of your being here
with Janet?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is splendid."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will be carrying her back to
the dreadful city with you before long?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think we will go in a few weeks.
School begins, you see, and we mustn't be too
late getting back."
</p>

<p>
"What a change it will be for dear Janet!"
Miss Clark continued.  "I can't say I altogether
approve."
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it will change her, and I hate to think
of her getting cityfied and filling her head with
notions."  Miss Clark did not specify just exactly
what notions were.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are very dear and sweet," she
continued, "but you are not at all like our Janet;
though you look very much alike, I would never
confuse you for an instant."
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I am, and I don't want to hurt your
feelings when I say that I hope you will not let
Janet change too much."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I think it will do her good to go to the
city.  She will meet lots of nice girls and go to
school, and certainly anything would be better
than being alone so much of the time as she is
here.  I hope she learns to be like other girls
when she gets to town."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, I am afraid I can't agree with you,"
Miss Clark said sadly.  The blue dress hurried
off to pass the cake to Mrs. Todd, who was sitting
alone in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Stay with me, child," Mrs. Todd said when
she had helped herself.  "I want to look at you.
I thought this afternoon that you were like your
father in manner,"&mdash;her blue eyes searched the
brown ones.  Suddenly she frowned.  "Hello,
that's odd.  No, I can't be wrong.  You little
imps you, you've&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do hush, please; some one might hear
you, and not a soul has even suspected, not
even Auntie Mogs.  How did you guess?" Janet
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Eyes," Mrs. Todd said shortly.  "Yours
have little tiny flecks of gold in them, like your
mother's.  Phyllis's are clearer, less dreamy, like
her father's.  I won't give you away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks; you can't imagine what fun it is.
I am hearing all sorts of things about myself,
and I can't wait to compare notes with Phyllis."
</p>

<p>
Opportunity came a little later when they met
in the kitchen.  Phyllis repeated her numerous
conversations, and Janet told her that Mrs. Todd
had guessed.
</p>

<p>
"But she has promised not to say anything,"
she added.
</p>

<p>
"Good; don't let's change even for dinner.  I
believe we could fool Tommy and Auntie Mogs
all evening," Phyllis chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"It's lots of fun being you," Janet whispered,
as they went back into the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I love being you; it makes me wish I
really were," Phyllis answered.
</p>

<p>
Dinner passed without their game being discovered,
though their occasional fits of laughter
mystified Tommy and Auntie Mogs.  They might
have gotten safely to bed without their knowing if
it hadn't been for Boru and Galahad.
</p>

<p>
They came out into the garden after dinner,
pretending not to notice each other, for although
Tom had succeeded in making them eat from the
same dish, they were by no means friends.
</p>

<p>
Janet and Phyllis were walking up and down
the center path.  Sir Galahad purred softly and
looked up at his mistress.  Phyllis leaned down
and picked him up in her aims.  Janet let her
hand rest on Boru's head.
</p>

<p>
Tom came out of the house just as they made a
tableau by the old sundial.
</p>

<p>
At first he did not notice anything odd, but
after a minute he said:
</p>

<p>
"There's something wrong with the picture.  I
think it's your dresses.  They don't match your
animals.  Hold on a minute.  I've got it!" he
exclaimed.  "You've swapped clothes."
</p>

<p>
"And you just found it out," Phyllis teased.
</p>

<p>
Tom studied them for a minute and shook his
head solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"It's no wonder either; you are as alike as two
peas in a pod, except for the way you talk.  What
a lot of larks you will be able to have, but I
shouldn't wonder if you found it embarrassing
when you got a little older.  Perhaps I had better
brand you with your initials," he suggested&mdash;then
he added slowly, "Yes, I think on the whole
it would be a lot better for all concerned if I did."

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
GOOD-BY
</h3>

<p>
One morning at the close of the visit
Mrs. Page sent for Janet to come to her.
When she was seated in the chair by the
bed, the old lady looked at her for a long time
before she said anything.  When she did speak,
it was to ask a startling question.
</p>

<p>
"Janet, do you love me?" she inquired shortly.
</p>

<p>
Janet stared at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you or don't you?" Mrs. Page demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Why, grandmother, of course I do," Janet
replied quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you have always been kind to me and
taken care of me, I suppose," Janet said doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the only reason?"
</p>

<p>
"N-no, I love you because you are my grandmother."
</p>

<p>
"Do you love me as much as you do your Aunt
Marjorie?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what!"
</p>

<p>
"In a different way."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by different way?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I hardly know how to put it into words,"&mdash;Janet
hesitated.  "I love to be with Auntie
Mogs and I like to have her put her arm around
me and kiss me."
</p>

<p>
"I see," Mrs. Page spoke dryly, and laughed
a short unpleasant laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And you love me for the opposite reasons,
eh!" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they are opposite reasons,"
Janet replied.  "I love you&mdash;well, respectfully,
and I like to think of your being here.  I think
perhaps I'm proud that you are my grandmother."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Page seemed to think over what she had
heard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it may surprise you to hear it," she
said at last, "but I love you.  I love you very
dearly.  I have been a very selfish old woman and
perhaps I have not been very gentle with you.
Tom says I haven't.  Certainly I have never
kissed you and put my arm around you, but I
have always loved you.  I want you to remember
that.  You have always been very patient with
me too, and I realize it.  Sometimes I've wished
you would lose your temper, but now I'm glad
you didn't.  Phyllis is more like her father than
you are, but I suppose that serves me right.  I
thought that I could love her the first day I saw
her.  I do love her, but not as much as I love you.
You are the finer of the two and some day you'll
prove it."
</p>

<p>
She turned over and faced the wall Janet
rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"When I die,"&mdash;Mrs. Page spoke from the
depth of the pillow&mdash;"I am going to leave
everything I have to you.  I am telling you this
because you are going away, not because I think I
am going to die.  Now you may go."
</p>

<p>
Janet left the room, a queer feeling of regret in
her heart.  She wanted to take her grandmother
in her arms and kiss her as she knew Phyllis
would have done, but a restraint, born from the
custom of years, held her back, and she closed the
door behind her, softly, as she had always done.
</p>

<p>
Phyllis was nowhere to be found, so Janet went
up to the "widow's walk" to think over what her
grandmother had said.  She found Tom already
there, smoking his pipe and reading.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, what did grandmother want?" he
inquired lazily.  "You were with her an awfully
long time.  Phyllis got tired of waiting for you
and went off for a walk with Harry Waters."
</p>

<p>
"Tom,"&mdash;Janet spoke very seriously, and Tom
put down his book to listen&mdash;"when I go to the
city with Phyllis and Auntie Mogs may I come
back and see grandmother whenever I want to?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly you may; what makes you
ask?" Tom replied.
</p>

<p>
"Because I think grandmother is sorry I am
going; really sorry, I mean, not just angry; and
I think I ought to come back and see her every
once in a while," Janet told him.
</p>

<p>
"Bless your heart, I think you are right.
Auntie Mogs and I were talking about the same
thing only last night, and she said you could all
come up whenever she wanted you."  Tom pulled
her down beside him and rumpled her hair.
"Now are you satisfied?" he asked, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Janet nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all over again just what the plans
are!" she said as she settled herself comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"I should think you would know them all by
heart,"&mdash;Tom laughed.  "First of all you and
Phyllis will have to be separated for a few days.
I don't see how you will ever bear it, but you
must try.  Then Auntie Mogs and Phyllis will
go down to the city and get ready for your
arrival.  To hear Phyllis talk you would think that
the walls of your room were going to be hung
in gold and that no one could see to it but herself.
</p>

<p>
"But to resume.  As soon as everything is
ready for your ladyship I will take you down.  I
can picture your excitement now when you see
Auntie Mogs' library, and when you are comfortably
settled I will take a train West and start in
rebuilding my modest shanty so that it will be
ready to receive you in the spring."
</p>

<p>
Janet looked out over the water and tried to
picture all Tom had said, but she gave it up.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Tommy," she said suddenly,
"I made up my mind on this very spot to write
you that letter.  Doesn't it seem funny to think
that we are sitting here now together?"
</p>

<p>
"It does," Tom agreed slowly, "the only pity
is that you didn't write it before."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The remaining days passed rapidly, and the
date set for the departure came all too soon.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's only for a week," Phyllis said,
as they stood on the station platform, "but I feel
as though it were years."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," Janet replied sorrowfully.  "I wish
I could go home and sleep until Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"Make Tommy amuse you every minute, and
don't you dare to forget me even for a half a
second," Phyllis warned her.  "Oh, dear, here
comes the horrid old train!  Kiss me again for
good luck."
</p>

<p>
Janet kissed her, and then turned to her aunt.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Auntie Mogs," she said tearfully.
</p>

<p>
"You two babies!"  Miss Carter looked down
at the two doleful faces before her and laughed.
"It's dreadful to be separated, especially when
you are twins, isn't it?  But try and brace up,
both of you, and it will soon be over.  Good-by
for a little while, dearest child.  Tommy, take
good care of her, won't you?" she added, as she
said good-by to him.
</p>

<p>
"The very best; and we'll be down in one short
little week," he promised.
</p>

<p>
They boarded the train, and Janet insisted on
waiting until the last puff of smoke curled up
out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"It is going to be the longest week of my life,"
she said dismally.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The house without Phyllis was unbearable, and
Janet rowed over to the Enchanted Kingdom to
find consolation.  She knew that the workmen
would be in possession the next day, and
she wanted to have it all to herself once
more.
</p>

<p>
She patted the books and said good-by to all
her favorites.  As she knelt to read the title of
one of them she noticed the volume that she had
found Peter reading their last memorable day
together.  She took it from its shelf and opened it
idly.  Pictures of sheep and diagrams of gates
and fences did not interest her very much, and
she was just about to close it up when she had a
sudden idea.
</p>

<p>
She turned to the back of it, tore out a page that
had nothing on it, and with Peter's own pencil,
which she found on the floor under the sofa, she
started to write.
</p>

<p>
When she had finished her note read as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear Peter:</i>
</p>

<p>
"I am saying good-by to the Enchanted Kingdom,
for I am going away next week.  Of course
I will write you letters to boarding school, but
I wanted to leave this for you to find the first time
you come back.
</p>

<p>
"We had lots of good times together, didn't
we?  I suppose the next time we see each other
we won't want to pretend, so this is a last good-by
to Lord Carrot Tops from
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "THE PRINCESS OF THE<br>
  ENCHANTED KINGDOM."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When it was written, she folded it up and stuck
it between the leaves of the sheep book.  Then
she stood up to go.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, my wonderful Kingdom," she said.
"I will always love you better than any room in
the world."  She tiptoed to the window and
climbed out swiftly.
</p>

<p>
As she ran down the hill, her eyes smarted and
she did not look back.

CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
CONCLUSION
</h3>

<p>
An ordinary train pulled in on an ordinary
day at the Old Chester station.  A man
and a girl, with soft brown eyes blurred
by unshed tears, entered the Pullman car and
took the seats that the porter showed them.  Then
the car started again, and the girl leaned out of
the window.
</p>

<p>
"They are all there," she said.  "Harry,
Mrs. Todd, Mildred and Alice, and Martha.  I can't
believe I'm really going away from them."
</p>

<p>
"But you are, little sister of mine; you are
going to a brand new world, and I am anxious to
hear what you and another little sister of mine
are going to do in it."
</p>

<p>
"It's more her world than mine," the girl
reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just as this was more your world than
hers, but she came to your world and liked it,"
the man replied.  "Just as you are going to like
her world."
</p>

<p>
"And before you know it, both worlds are going
to be 'our world.'"
</p>

<p>
The girl, who was Janet, looked out of the
window and smiled, and the train seemed to hurry
them along.
